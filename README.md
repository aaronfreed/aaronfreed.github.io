I’m a political science and cybersecurity major from Sarasota, FL. Amateur game development, music creation and (re)mastering, and writing consume much of my spare time.

Pages currently hosted here:

* [*Marathon* soundtracks](https://aaronfreed.github.io/aaronfreed/soundtracks.html)

* ***[Apotheosis X](https://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5)***: sound restoration, scripting

* ***Where Monsters Are in Dreams*** (forthcoming): maps, sound, scripting, OST mastering, writing, graphics, codirector
* ***Marathon Chronicles*** (in progress): maps, writing, sound, music, graphics, director

I also run a YouTube channel: **https://youtube.com/@MarathonVidmaster**

I have at least slightly more than cursory knowledge of the following languages (though in a few cases it was years or even decades ago):

* English (obviously)
* Spanish
* Latin
* German
* C#
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Lua
* Java
* BASIC
* Pascal
* Assembly

And *actually* cursory knowledge of:

* C
* C++
* OpenGL
* Rust

(Though my knowledge of these is improving.)

More to come when I feel like updating this further.
