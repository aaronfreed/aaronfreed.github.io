I&rsquo;m a political science and cybersecurity major from Sarasota, FL. Amateur game development, music creation and (re)mastering, and writing consume much of my spare time.

I also run a YouTube channel: **[https://youtube.com/@MarathonVidmaster](https://youtube.com/@MarathonVidmaster)**

I have at least slightly more than cursory knowledge of the following languages (though in a few cases it was years or even decades ago):

* English (obviously)
* Spanish
* Latin
* German
* C#
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Lua
* Java
* BASIC
* Pascal
* Assembly

And *actually* cursory knowledge of:

* C
* C++
* OpenGL
* Rust

(Though my knowledge of these is improving.)

More to come when I feel like updating this further.
