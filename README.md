I&rsquo;m a political science and cybersecurity major from Sarasota, FL. Amateur game development, music creation and (re)mastering, and writing consume much of my spare time.

I’m currently heavily involved in developing the following code project:

* **[Vasara 2.0b](https://github.com/aaronfreed/vasara/)**: A Lua texturing utility for **[*Marathon* Aleph One](https://alephone.lhowon.org/)** originally created by **[@Hopper262](https://github.com/Hopper262)** and **Ares Ex Machina**, building on **[Visual Mode.lua](https://github.com/treellama/visualmode)**, which in turn was written by **[@jonirons](https://github.com/jonirons)** and **[@treellama](https://github.com/treellama)** and effectively functions like the command line to Vasara&rsquo;s GUI. As neither plugin had been substantially updated since 2016, I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself (with a bit of assistance from **[@SolraBizna](https://github.com/SolraBizna)** and **[@murbruksprodukt](https://github.com/murbruksprodukt)**) to update Vasara to implement new Aleph One features, fix longstanding bugs, and add new features to make texturing easier. This remains a work in progress; when I&rsquo;m satisfied with the results, I may backport some of these changes to Visual Mode.lua. This will only function with Aleph One 1.7 or later, and it is best used with **[Weland](https://github.com/treellama/weland/releases)** (see the readme for an abbreviated setup guide, or my content creation guide directly below for a detailed one).

Pages currently hosted here:

* **[*Marathon Istoria*: Conversations with the Dead (major spoilers)](https://aaronfreed.github.io/istoria_body_messages.html)**: A catalog of all Yellow Crystal messages in the Aleph One scenario *Istoria*, the keywords used to display them, and the locations of all 28 bodies in the scenario. (Again, please don&rsquo;t read this until you&rsquo;ve finished *Istoria* at least once.)

I&rsquo;ve contributed in varying degrees to the following (mostly) playable game mods. (Dates refer to my involvement with each project rather than its entire development cycle, though in a few cases these are identical.) See the *Marathon* soundtracks page above for links to soundtracks.

* ***[Eternal X](http://eternal.bungie.org/)*** (2018-present): maps, music, sound, writing, scripting, graphics, soundtrack (re)mastering, codirector *(alongside **pfhorrest**, for versions 1.2.1 and later)*
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6kiy7CaniLiZSRi-5P-SKEN)
   * This scenario remains under active development; a final release of version 1.3 is still forthcoming. Five previews of 1.3 have been released; a sixth will likely appear in December 2023 or January 2024.
* ***[Apotheosis X](https://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5)*** (2020-2023): sound, scripting, testing
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6mOBZaoKUAOqDsfuv-RIneq)
   * Further updates of *Apotheosis X* have not been ruled out but are not currently under active development.
* ***[Dungeons Presents Hellpak Vol. 1: Not Recommended by Doctors](https://simplici7y.com/items/dungeons-hellpak-vol-1-not-recommended-by-doctors)*** (2020-2023): maps, scripting, soundtrack mastering, writing, graphics, bug fix releases
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6kcfNGN3zh0BcsyaLRFkB0k)
   * [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DTMvjFqtTA)
   * This is an iteration of creator tbcr&rsquo;s long-running *Dungeons* show, hence its full title. One further (hopefully final) bug fix update for this scenario will be released in December 2023.
* ***Trojan*** (2020-2021): sound remastering, soundtrack remastering
   * There are multiple versions of this game for Aleph One:
      * [The first](https://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-trojan/) is a direct conversion of the original game files to Aleph One format by Shappie, with which treellama and I assisted. I did not directly create any content involved with this release.
      * [The second](https://hhas01.itch.io/trojan-se) is a more complicated conversion of the original game files by original creator Hamish Sanderson with some added extras, including my remastered music and sounds. This, unfortunately, does not run on current versions of Aleph One, but you can probably use the remastered music and sounds with Shappie&rsquo;s conversion above.
* ***[Marathon Phoenix](https://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-phoenix-2/)*** (2020, tangentially): soundtrack remastering
   * [Creator RyokoTK&rsquo;s gameplay and commentary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-_EnUuI9PUoIncYlqgWainfOUoZAXhCY)
   * [Additional gameplay by me and others](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6k2XxgTocOm9kxC-y6jXAZI)

I&rsquo;m also working on several forthcoming mods:

* ***Dungeons Presents Hellpak Vol. 2: An Exercise in Questionable Taste*** (2023-present, forthcoming): maps, scripting, music, soundtrack mastering, writing
   * [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DTMvjFqtTA)
   * We welcome most contributions from anyone, but please don&rsquo;t send us more music; we already have more than five hours, which is more than enough for both both *Vol. 2* and *Vol. 3*&rsquo;s soundtracks.
* ***Tempus Irae Redux*** (2020-present, forthcoming): maps, music, sound, scripting, writing, soundtrack mastering
   * [Get the original *Tempus Irae* here](http://nardo.bungie.org/alephone.php)
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6nVJdLAfq0ZxS6WRv0bC3Fe)
   * I didn&rsquo;t contribute to the original *Tempus Irae* but have been involved in *Redux*&rsquo;s development since it started in roughly May 2020. *Redux* isn&rsquo;t a straight remaster but more of a modern update; since it significantly changes several levels, players may find it interesting to play both. It also isn&rsquo;t planned to supersede the original *Tempus Irae*; the latter&rsquo;s original Aleph One release will continue to be available on Nardo&rsquo;s website after we release *Redux*. We entered a limited beta test in October 2023 with an aim to release the game in December 2023 or January 2024.
* ***Where Monsters Are in Dreams*** (2019-present, forthcoming): maps, music, sound, scripting, soundtrack mastering, writing, graphics, codirector *(alongside **CryoS** and **hypersleep**)*
   * [Website](http://bighouse.bungie.org/wmaid/)
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6kB_7qLbTdgia1hiNOoYmEz)
   * A perpetually in-development scenario (I believe its development stretches back at least as far as 2001). Hypersleep and CryoS are two of the main forces behind *Apotheosis X*; the three of us have recently recommitted to finally finishing this monster (pun intended) and have a detailed, step-by-step roadmap to do so. We&rsquo;re hoping for a late 2024/early 2025 release, but we&rsquo;ve overshot so many estimates that it&rsquo;s become a running gag, so take that with not just a grain or even a boulder of salt but in fact an entire salt mine.
* ***Return to Marathon* Chapter 2** (2023-present, forthcoming): maps, music, sound, scripting, graphics
   * [*Return to Marathon* website](http://bighouse.bungie.org/rtm/)
   * [*Return to Marathon* Chapter 1](https://citadel.lhowon.org/scenarios/return-to-marathon/)
   * I didn&rsquo;t contribute to *Return to Marathon*&rsquo;s first chapter, but I&rsquo;ll be helping to polish up its maps for the release of the full game. Development resumed in August 2023.
* ***Marathon Chronicles*** (1997-present, in progress): maps, writing, sound, music, graphics, soundtrack mastering, director
   * [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6k1ExcIEZMIOWc9wfgIkYmL)
   * [Most recent public release](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BtHg2LzQBth25hxB-AURAs8um3yyCaTE), which is now a few years old. I&rsquo;ll release a current build after we release *Tempus Irae Redux*, since *Chronicles* incorporates many of its textures; out of respect for James&rsquo; phenomenal efforts on *Tempus Irae* and *Redux*, I will not be releasing them in any form ahead of *Redux* itself.
   * *Chronicles* is planned to be a sort of grand finale to a loose arc between the fan games *Rubicon*, *Eternal X*, *Phoenix*, *Where Monsters Are in Dreams* (listed in original release order rather than in-universe chronological order). It is planned to resolve Hathor&rsquo;s story, to address some ramifications of *Rubicon*&rsquo;s story, and to resolve the ramifications of the conflict revealed towards the end of *Eternal*.
     However, despite its having technically been in development for nearly two-thirds of my life, it&rsquo;s probably less than half complete. I plan for its second half to be fairly atypical for *Marathon* gameplay, with perhaps dozens of interconnected levels featuring nonlinear objectives and items that enable players to progress in several different ways; they&rsquo;ll be able to obtain these in nearly any order, meaning its objectives will have several possible solutions. None of this is implemented yet, though, and *Chronicles* is currently on the backburner at least until *Tempus Irae Redux* is complete.

In case that wasn&rsquo;t enough, I also run a **[YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@MarathonVidmaster)**.

All of the above game mods use the **[Aleph One engine](https://alephone.lhowon.org/download.html)**. You may also wish to familiarize yourself with the **[*Marathon* trilogy](https://alephone.lhowon.org/scenarios.html)**; in particular, *Hellpak* runs under *Marathon Infinity*.

I have at least slightly more than cursory knowledge of the following languages (though in a few cases it was years or even decades ago):

* English (obviously)
* Spanish
* Latin
* German
* C#
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Lua
* Java
* BASIC
* Pascal
* Assembly
* C
* C++
* OpenGL
* Rust

My knowledge of several of these languages is still only *slightly* more than cursory, but in some cases (e.g., Rust, OpenGL, and C++), it is improving. (In C++&rsquo;s case, this is quite begrudging, as every time I find myself writing C++ code, I find myself wishing I were writing Rust or Lua instead.)

You can contact me on Discord at **@Aaron#6608** (or **@aaron6608**). We&rsquo;ll need a server in common if you don&rsquo;t want to wait for me to check my message requests; the **[*Hellpak* Discord](https://discord.gg/DTMvjFqtTA)** and **[*Marathon* Discord](https://discord.gg/NmE66Mhq2a)** are two of your best bets. You can also contact me through my **[YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@MarathonVidmaster)**. I don&rsquo;t check email often enough for that to be a reliable form of contact.

I&rsquo;m also a member of **[last.fm](http://last.fm/user/Cassandra-Leo)**, **[Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/~Cassandra_Leo)**, and several other websites that I check even less often than I check my email; however, those interested in my musical influences may find them enlightening.

More to come when I feel like updating this further.
