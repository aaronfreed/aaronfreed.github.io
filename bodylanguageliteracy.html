<p>The baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson, due to no fault of his own, was functionally illiterate until his wife taught him to read and write. Writing about him led me to an epiphany: we barely think through many common literacy-related metaphors. It’s generally uncontroversial to refer to multiple levels of proficiency in both written and spoken languages. But when it comes to the term “body language”, we’re wildly inconsistent.</p>

<p>To be clear, “body language” is itself a metaphor, but we routinely extend it further: we routinely speak of “reading” people, their body language, or their emotions. This implies that body language possesses its own form of literacy, but we rarely consider the deeper implications of this.</p>

It’s always frustrated me that neurotypicals can naturally read each other’s body language, for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Neurodivergent people don’t naturally possess this skill and must learn it.</li>
	<li>Neurodivergent body language differs from neurotypicals body language (and from each other’s).</li>
	<li>Few neurotypicals know #2.</li>
	<li>Neurotypicals also often can’t tell I’m neurodivergent, and I’m often in situations where I either can’t disclose my neurodivergence, or don’t think it’s a good idea.</li>
	<li>Thus, I often must mimic the body language I believe (perhaps accurately, perhaps not) I’d be exhibiting if I were neurotypical, which is known as mirroring or masking.</li>
	<li>This is draining, and sometimes I lose the ability to do it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have two hot takes here:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/moonlight.html#shoelessjoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shoeless Joe not only didn’t throw the 1919 World Series, but played spectacularly well in it.</a></li>
	<li>Body language possesses, for lack of a better term, its own form of literacy and should be taught in schools.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Can</em> body language be taught? As it happens, yes. I’ve learned it. It took me until my late thirties to be properly taught to do so, but it’s entirely possible. And it’s almost impossible to overstate how much good it’s done me. I wouldn’t have written this piece if I hadn’t, because I almost certainly wouldn’t have gotten this job, and I certainly wouldn’t have had enough insight to be able to write it.</p>

<p>The potential benefit goes further, though. As I said, most neurotypicals don’t understand that neurodivergent body language differs. Teaching body language in schools would be one of the best ways I can imagine to help dispel this widespread misconception. In turn, this would prevent massive amounts of micommunication, providing massive benefit to neurotypicals and neurodivergent people alike.</p>

<p>I in no way mean to compare the severity of these forms of illiteracy. I learned to read when I was two years old: I have no recollection of what it felt like to not understand written language. I can’t imagine what a handicap it must be to be unable to read as an adult. I suspect that the only people that can truly testify to which form of illiteracy is more severe are neurodivergent people who only learned to read the written word and body language alike as adults – and even then, experiences vary widely widely, so they likely can only speak to which was more severe <em>for them</em>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, body language illiteracy – both our own and neurotypicals’ – can cost us jobs, either because we fail to read neurotypical body language, or because neurotypicals misread ours. I’ve had this happen, and it was so unpleasant that to this day, some twelve years later, I haven’t set foot in the that employer’s store since. Although this was a clear ADA violation, I didn’t have sufficient evidence to prove my case in court, and the payment I would have been entitled to wouldn’t have been worth the emotional turmoil of going through the litigation process in the first place. I’m sure this happens routinely.</p>

<p>What can we do?</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Teach body language in schools.</strong> Neurotypicals might protest at first that they can already read others’ body language, but hopefully, many will come to realize that this isn’t as much a waste of time as it might initially seem since, without even realizing it, they’d been misreading several of their classmates’ body language. And, of course, this will be immensely helpful to neurodivergent people.</li>
	<li><strong>Make fewer assumptions about others’ body language.</strong> Unless you specifically <em>know</em> a person is neurotypical, don’t assume that you’re necessarily reading them correctly.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to assume good faith on others’ part.</strong> Someone who seems mad at you may be mad at someone else, or stressed, or simply having a bad day.</li>
	<li><strong>If you think your body language has been misread, clarify.</strong> Avoid directly accusatory language. Something like “I’m sorry if my stress is making me seem angry at you” is ideal, since it clarifies that your intentions aren’t hostile; however, a neutral observation like “I think you may be reading my stress as anger at you” is still better than a direct accusation like “Why are you misreading my stress as anger at you?”, which certainly won’t do anything to dispel the appearance of anger.</li>
	<li><strong>If someone thinks you’ve misread them, try to learn how to avoid such misreadings in the future.</strong> If you don’t know how to determine that someone’s ability to mirror or mask has broken down, you may wish to ask them to notify you when that happens. Similarly, if you suspect this is occurring but aren’t sure, ask.</p>
	<li><strong>De-escalate when possible.</strong> If you misread someone, even out of an honest lack of knowledge, apologize for the misunderstanding anyway. It’s the best way to confirm that you didn’t have any malicious intent.</li>
	<li><strong>Forgive the honest mistakes of people who are willing to learn.</strong> We don’t know what we don’t know. As long as someone isn’t <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/amathiakaiagnoia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">willfully refusing to learn</a>, we can’t blame them for not having learned something they’ve never been exposed to before. Many people have simply never learned that neurodivergent body language differs from neurotypical body language, and if they don’t know that, it’s hardly fair to blame them for failing to read the former correctly, as long as they’re willing to learn.</li>
	<li><strong>Be open to new ideas.</strong> No one knows everything. We all have room for improvement.</li>
</ol>
