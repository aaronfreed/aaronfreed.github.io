<p class="fixheight">This is a (still un&shy;fin&shy;ished) col&shy;lec&shy;tion of tracks I&rsquo;ve writ&shy;ten (or, in one case, cowritten) for game sound&shy;tracks since 2023. They&rsquo;re cur&shy;rent&shy;ly all in&shy;ten&shy;ded ei&shy;ther for <em class="accent weight3">hell&shy;pak Vol. 2</em> or <em class="accent weight3 dotted" lang="la" title="Latin, literally meaning &ldquo;Time of Wrath Returned&rdquo;. Obligatory Latin pedantry: &ldquo;returned&rdquo; is a participle modifying &rdquo;time&rdquo; (this is syntactically clear due to &ldquo;&imacr;rae&rdquo; being the only word of the title in the genitive case); also, the &lsquo;I&rsquo; is a long vowel (i.e., if using macrons to stand in for apices, we&rsquo;d have &ldquo;Tempus &Imacr;rae Redux&rdquo;). Now cross off a square on your bingo cards.">Tem&shy;pus Irae Re&shy;dux</em>, which are both forth&shy;com&shy;ing third-par&shy;ty sce&shy;na&shy;ri&shy;os for <span class="accent weight3">Bun&shy;gie</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em> se&shy;ries, though I don&rsquo;t know for sure where they&rsquo;ll end up.</p>

<p class="fixheight">This al&shy;bum is <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/music/compositions2023-2024.html" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">free to lis&shy;ten to or down&shy;load on&shy;line</a>. I&rsquo;ve made it av&shy;ail&shy;ab&shy;le in two forms: as <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgeo9dCMSz8QFVNaQTA?e=Oj7nWw" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;du&shy;al tracks</a> and as an <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgesiOzXQSqOdgyvO1A?e=aTGiRQ" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">al&shy;bum im&shy;age with an em&shy;bed&shy;ded cue&shy;sheet</a> (any me&shy;di&shy;a play&shy;er worth its salt should be ab&shy;le to read the in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;du&shy;al songs with&shy;in the lat&shy;ter). I also pro&shy;vide cue&shy;sheets (for both the in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;du&shy;al tracks and the al&shy;bum image) that split the songs into the in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;du&shy;al move&shy;ments, should an&shy;y&shy;one wish to do so.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Please <a href="aboutme.html" class="underline songlink">ask me for per&shy;mis&shy;sion</a> be&shy;fore us&shy;ing its tracks in your own pro&shy;jects, though.

(I real&shy;ize this isn&rsquo;t ideal for ac&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;bi&shy;li&shy;ty and plan to work on a so&shy;lu&shy;tion ev&shy;en&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly, but I&rsquo;m cur&shy;rent&shy;ly too busy fin&shy;ish&shy;ing the un&shy;fin&shy;ished songs in this col&shy;lec&shy;tion and wor&shy;king on <em class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">Tem&shy;pus Irae Re&shy;dux</em> to im&shy;ple&shy;ment the so&shy;lu&shy;tion that comes to mind, i.e., con&shy;ver&shy;ting ev&shy;er&shy;y last one in&shy;to an end&shy;note.)</p>

<p class="fixheight">I link to You&shy;Tube vi&shy;de&shy;os of most songs I men&shy;tion by oth&shy;er ar&shy;tists. I us&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly link to the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;al stu&shy;di&shy;o al&shy;bum re&shy;lea&shy;ses of rock songs, though I oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;al&shy;ly link to mu&shy;sic vi&shy;de&shy;os or no&shy;ta&shy;ble live per&shy;for&shy;man&shy;ces as well. Like&shy;wise, I us&shy;u&shy;al&shy;ly link to the OST ver&shy;sions of game tracks, on of&shy;fic&shy;ial chan&shy;nels where pos&shy;sib&shy;le (cer&shy;tain de&shy;ve&shy;lo&shy;pers, Nin&shy;ten&shy;do es&shy;pec&shy;ial&shy;ly, rare&shy;ly up&shy;load their OSTs), with a few spe&shy;ci&shy;fic ex&shy;cep&shy;tions:</p>

I came up with &#x300C;星七つの伝説&#x300D; (hiragana: &#x300C;ほしななつのでんせつ&#x300D;; r&omacr;maji: &ldquo;Hoshi nanatsu no densetsu&rdquo;). &#x300C;星&#x300D; (&#x300C;ほし&#x300D;, &ldquo;hoshi&rdquo;) means &ldquo;star&rdquo;, &#x300C;七&#x300D; (&#x300C;なな&#x300D;, &ldquo;nana&rdquo;) means &ldquo;seven&rdquo;, &#x300C;つ&#x300D; (&ldquo;-tsu&rdquo;) is a suffix turning a number into a generic counter, &#x300C;の&#x300D; (&ldquo;no&rdquo;) is a genitive case marker (similar to &ldquo;-&rsquo;s&rdquo;), and &#x300C;伝説&#x300D; (&#x300C;でんせつ&#x300D;, &ldquo;densetsu&rdquo;) means &ldquo;legend&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know enough Japanese to know a better counter for stars than &#x300C;つ&#x300D;, if one even exists; nor whether to use &#x300C;つ&#x300D; or &#x300C;個&#x300D; (&#x300C;こ&#x300D;, &ldquo;-ko&rdquo;, another generic counter); nor whether the number and counter precede or follow &#x300C;星&#x300D; &ndash; &#x300C;シンドバッド&#x3000;&#xFF17;つの海の伝説&#x300D; (kana: &#x300C;シンドバッド&#x3000;&#xFF17;つのうみのでんせつ&#x300D;, r&omacr;maji: &ldquo;Shinobaddo: Nanatsu no umi no densetsu&rdquo;; translation: &ldquo;Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas&rdquo;) puts the number and counter first, but Japanese Wikipedia&rsquo;s article on space tends to put nouns first.">Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</a></em></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For <span class="weight3 accent">David Wise</span>&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent dotted" title="known in Japan as スーパードンキーコン&#x30B0; (S&umacr;p&amacr; Donk&imacr; Kongu), or &ldquo;Super Donkey Kong&rdquo;">Donkey Kong Country</em> music, I link to the OST (to show <span class="toc-counter weight2">Wise</span>&rsquo;s vir&shy;tu&shy;os&shy;ic use of the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">SNES</span>&rsquo; sound chip) and to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKaTWjXt6tJ9S6K0YFJVEfQ" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">Jam&shy;min&rsquo; Sam Mil&shy;ler</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vJuAh_vWPdtWtOIVWFeZXAL9K0L8K3SV" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">re&shy;makes</a> (which use the same eth&shy;os as <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Syn&shy;the&shy;tic Or&shy;ig&shy;ins</em>&rsquo;).</li>
</ul>

<p class="fixheight">For clas&shy;si&shy;cal music, if I know the per&shy;for&shy;mance date, con&shy;duc&shy;tor, or or&shy;ches&shy;tra, I list it in a tool&shy;tip.</p>

<p class="fixheight">The &ldquo;DR&rdquo; scores are mea&shy;sures of songs&rsquo; overall dynamic range, made with the <span class="weight3 accent">TT Dy&shy;nam&shy;ic Range Me&shy;ter</span> plug&shy;in for <span class="weight3 accent">foo&shy;bar&shy;2000</span>. (This plug&shy;in ap&shy;par&shy;ent&shy;ly hasn&rsquo;t been av&shy;ail&shy;able for down&shy;load in years &ndash; I in&shy;tend to lo&shy;cate the best av&shy;ail&shy;ab&shy;le al&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tive and will link to it once I lo&shy;cate it.) The high&shy;er the score, the high&shy;er a song&rsquo;s dy&shy;nam&shy;ic range. Mu&shy;sic from the last 20 years tends to score in the DR5&ndash;DR7 range &ndash; thus, this al&shy;bum is both more dy&shy;nam&shy;ic and qui&shy;e&shy;ter than most mod&shy;ern music. Use your vol&shy;ume knob if ne&shy;ces&shy;sa&shy;ry.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Lastly, the predominance of Italian and Latin song titles is a direct result of <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>&rsquo;s Italian setting. I left a few direct references to other works in English (the isolated phrase &ldquo;you wanted to&rdquo; is literally, not figuratively, untranslatable to Italian or Latin, which don&rsquo;t have split infinitives, while any translations I could formulate of &ldquo;co-starring&rdquo; were infuriatingly wordy), and I titled one movement in Spanish and two tracks in (very likely ungrammatical) Greek for reasons explained below, but titling most of them in Italian or Latin felt appropriate.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">While writing this movement, I briefly thought I&rsquo;d rewritten <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Main Theme of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>&rdquo;</span>; then I played it back and realized I hadn&rsquo;t, which resulted in this song&rsquo;s admittedly bizarre title. At this point, writing a pastiche of <span class="weight3 accent">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s music felt inevitable, so I leaned into it and gave what became its three movements cheeky titles based on their obvious inspirations.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Since I hadn&rsquo;t fully settled on this being a <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> pastiche when I wrote it, this movement probably has the most distinct identity. Despite its relative melodic and harmonic simplicity, its arrangement goes through several major changes that hopefully will keep it engaging. The transition at the end is probably this movement&rsquo;s most complicated and unexpected aspect.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This was, believe it or not, supposed to be merely a study in 5:4 polyrhythms (which is distinct from, though in this case coincidentally linked to, 5/4 time signatures). However, the bass line I wrote for this movement steadfastly refused to work in anything except groups of seven (<a href="https://marathon.bungie.org/story/seven.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">yes Hamish</a>), and the <a href="https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">Oblique Strategies</a> suggested keeping it that way, so I began this song with the extraordinarily unusual 7:5 polyrhythm. Groups of 6 and 4 naturally worked their way in as I wrote additional instrument parts, hence the song&rsquo;s title.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For those curious, I actually notated this as 4/4 in Logic, so much like <span class="toc-counter weight2">Meshuggah</span>, I could truthfully claim the mind-warping polyrhythms I&rsquo;ve created here are entirely in 4/4. However, I don&rsquo;t actually <em>feel</em> it as 4/4; I usually feel it either as 5/4 or as 7/4, depending on whether I&rsquo;m focusing more on the drums or the bass.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">The Mellotron introduces this new movement&rsquo;s chords before the bass enters, followed by the organ and two different guitar parts. The bass line repeatedly suggests <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Chomber&rdquo;</span> from <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> &ndash; since I was writing this for a <em>Marathon</em> scenario and had by this point settled on using groupings of seven for the bass parts throughout the entire track, the reference felt obligatory. However, I always throw some additional notes into the mix.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;m not entirely pleased with this guitar part &amp; may rewrite it. The organ solo is delectable, though.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Guitar and bass rarely engage in counterpoint in rock music. I love counterpoint and would love to hear more of it, so I wrote the guitar part as a counterpoint to the bass line. I&rsquo;m extremely pleased with the effect; it almost sounds like a rock fugue.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Midway through this movement, I add strings and some ethereal <em class="weight3 accent">Dark Side of the Moon</em>-style choral vocals that end up being the song&rsquo;s final elements as the others stop playing. (Before adding the strings, I&rsquo;d begun writing a fourth movement that I yeeted after noticing that it was virtually identical to <span class="weight3 accent">Chris Christodoulou</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/67BwWgrMlxk" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Coalescence</a>&rdquo;</span> [<em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em>, 2013].)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve never played a <em class="accent weight3">Donkey Kong Country</em> game and, to my knowledge, hadn&rsquo;t heard any of its brilliant music until <span class="dotted" title="June 11, 2024, in ISO 8601 (the objectively correct date format)">2024-06-11</span>. I note this because any <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> fan will immediately peg <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> as an unapologetic tribute to its most famous track, <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. (Right down to its title, in fact: <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> is Latin for <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. I see little point in concealing my influences.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I grew up listening to <span class="accent weight3">David Wise</span>&rsquo;s music; I played the NES <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marble Madness</em> ad nauseam as a child, plus <em class="toc-counter weight2">California Games</em> and likely <em class="toc-counter weight2">Battletoads</em> and maybe a few other games he worked on as well. But Wise&rsquo;s reputation primarily rests on his <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> soundtracks, and with good reason: they use the <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>&rsquo;s limited sound chip as virtuosically as <span class="toc-counter weight2">Square</span>&rsquo;s greatest 16-bit composers (<span class="toc-counter weight2">Hiroki Kikuta</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Yasunori Mitsuda</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Y&omacr;ko Shimomura</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Nobuo Uematsu</span>, etc.) did. If the <span class="toc-counter weight2">Follin brothers</span> hadn&rsquo;t existed, they&rsquo;d be the absolute upper echelon in this category. On which note, R.I.P. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Geoff</span> :(</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I first heard <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> in a <a href="https://youtu.be/4DgPmI6S_So" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">video</a> jazz pianist <span class="toc-counter weight2">Charles Cornell</span> ostensibly made about <span class="toc-counter weight2">K&omacr;ji Kond&omacr;</span>&rsquo;s (also brilliant) music for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Super Mario 64</em>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Dire, Dire Docks&rdquo;</span>. Cornell actually spent more than half its runtime gushing about Wise&rsquo;s track, and I immediately understood why; it struck a nerve on a primal level. Not only did I know, on first listen, that it was a masterpiece, but I immediately wanted to write a more energetic track with an otherwise similar mood &ndash; which is not an urge I frequently get.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">So, having heard Wise&rsquo;s piece probably no more than twice, I sat down, put its first two chords (which Cornell had analyzed in detail) into <span class="toc-counter weight2">Logic Pro</span>&rsquo;s arpeggiator, wrote a chord progression that felt like a natural follow-up, and sketched out the melodies and arrangement overnight. I&rsquo;d already finished a rough mix by sunrise of 2024-06-12. I&rsquo;ve since added a few background embellishments, but the fundaments are unchanged.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">It&rsquo;s rare (get it? because <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">developer</a> is&hellip; never mind) for a song to emerge almost fully formed so quickly for me; usually, <em>something</em> about my first attempt doesn&rsquo;t work, but this just flowed out of me (if you&rsquo;ll pardon the obvious water metaphor) as an expression of my contemporary emotional and mental state. I felt particularly alienated by the conduct of certain individuals in the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> community: one of my closest friends (who&rsquo;s seriously ill) had poured eighteen months into tutoring me for apparently fruitless ends. (I&rsquo;ve withheld names and further specifics to protect the <del style="text-decoration-thickness: 0.5px;">innocent</del> guilty, but we ultimately <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-Bet-Marathon/alephbet" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">forked the engine</a>.) It is not strictly incorrect to read this song as a reflection of my existential despair at the time.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> is obviously one of the best game tracks of all time, and in no way do I think I&rsquo;ve duplicated its quality &ndash; especially because, again, Wise was doing all of that on a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>! To avoid plagiarism (<a href="https://youtu.be/UQHaGhC7C2E" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">a famous Russian mathematician&rsquo;s contrary advice</a> aside), I didn&rsquo;t listen to Wise&rsquo;s piece again until I finished writing mine &ndash; and when I did, I was pretty astonished at how closely I&rsquo;d approximated its mood and atmosphere. But I can hardly consider myself an unbiased source, so I&rsquo;ll quote one of my early listeners:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight toc-counter">&ldquo;I think you really captured the spirit of the OG while still giving it a danceable (beat, rhythm, etc. &ndash; not sure on the vocab). It&rsquo;s got more energy than the source material :)&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight">So I&rsquo;ll chalk that one up as a success.</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">This track will play on the <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="toc-counter centred fixheight">composer: <span class="accent weight3">Aaron Freed</span>, 2024</p>

		<ol class="shortmargin loweralpha" style="font-size: 18px;">
			<li id="04a"><span class="toc-counter weight4">Side A</span> <span class="green">(0:00-6:00)</span> <span class="orange">[DR14]</span></li>

		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">This song was an experiment in two different ways:</p>

		<ol class="normal fixheight">
			<li>I was experimenting with <span class="accent weight3">Logic Pro</span>&rsquo;s new session bassist and session keyboardist (thus the subtitle)</li>
			<li>I was seeking to answer a question no one had asked, &ldquo;Does disco need a 4/4 time signature to feel like disco?&rdquo; (The answer, surprisingly, is no.)</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">Logic&rsquo;s session keyboardists are&hellip; well, they&rsquo;re quite good at coming up with jazzy accompaniments, but you couldn&rsquo;t rely on them to come up with the main melodies of a track. The session bassist, though, is unbelievably good &ndash; the performance is full of realistic-sounding slides and unbelievable hooks. I&rsquo;d already relied heavily on the session drummer in my previous arrangements &ndash; I&rsquo;m not a drummer, and whenever I write drum parts myself, they feel less natural to me than the parts I&rsquo;ve created with Logic&rsquo;s session drummer. The bassist is even better than that.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Logic&rsquo;s session players all require substantial user input to get the kinds of performances found here; users must, at the bare minimum, specify chords and performance styles. There are also parameters for the rhythmic patterns the session players use; the complexity, intensity, and dynamic range of their performances; the melodic range of the bassist and keyboardist&rsquo;s performances; how much swing they use; how much they deviate from the metronome (&ldquo;humanize&rdquo;); how in front of or behind the beat they play (&ldquo;feel&rdquo;); the frequency and complexity of their fills; what kinds of arpeggiation the &ldquo;arpeggiated&rdquo; keyboardist performs; the kind of voicings the keyboardist plays with each hand; how many grace notes the keyboardist performs; how many ghost notes the drummer performs; how many notes and what kind of grooves the bassist performs; how many slides, blue notes, and dead notes the bassist performs; and more beyond that. I always customize all of these &ndash; in particular, I usually crank &ldquo;complexity&rdquo;, &ldquo;fill amount&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fill complexity&rdquo; all the way up.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The first half of this song features a steadily building arrangement that I wrote for the OST, but the structure heard here will not necessarily match what players hear in the game exactly. As players complete mission objectives in the level this track will appear in, the game will add melodic layers to the existing arrangement. Thus, the music will get louder and more complex as players progress through the level.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">That said, I was impressed enough with Logic&rsquo;s session musicians that I decided to feature them without my added accompaniments for the second half of the song &ndash; it feels like a modern structural equivalent of extended 12&rdquo; disco mixes that used to feature lengthy instrumental breakdowns towards the end.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The song title is a take-off on a movement of <span class="accent weight3">Genesis</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/9hKYpNpajpI" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Supper&rsquo;s Ready</a>&rdquo;</span>, namely <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8 (co-starring the delicious talents of Gabble Ratchet)&rdquo;</span>. I began using this title semi-ironically, but the more I thought about it, the more it felt appropriate. For one thing, its chord progression strongly resembles one I used in a song I performed on my <em><a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/music/demos2014.html" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">Demos 2014</a></em> album that I named simply <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span>. I habitually used to perform <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span> after covering an excerpt of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span> that doesn&rsquo;t strictly belong to either <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> or to its preceding movement, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Willow Farm&rdquo;</span> &ndash; in fact, it appears on <em class="toc-counter weight2">Demos 2014</em> in that exact format. So, effectively, if <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span> used to take the place of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> when I covered a segment of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span>, then it feels appropriate to name a track with a similar chord progression after <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The other major inspiration on this feels too obvious to note, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway: <span class="accent weight3">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: &#x300C;プレ&#x30EA;ュード&#x300D;, &ldquo;Purery&umacr;do&rdquo; (note: this link is to Mathew Valente&rsquo;s excellent restoration of the Final Fantasy VI arrangement)">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/albC3EHqeL4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Prelude</a>&rdquo;</span> from the <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> series. I&rsquo;m noting it because, until I began watching <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: スタジオジ&#x30D6;&#x30EA; (Sutajio Jiburi)">Studio Ghibli</span>&rsquo;s filmography from start to finish in 2024, I didn&rsquo;t realize how large an influence <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: 久石 譲, Hisaishi J&omacr;; stage name of &#34276;澤 守 (Fujisawa Mamoru)">Joe Hisaishi</span> had so many Japanese composers. I&rsquo;d liken the experience to that of a person who&rsquo;d only listened to Western pop music from the last 50 years for their entire life finally hearing <span class="accent weight3">the Beatles</span>. None of the composers I&rsquo;d listened to bothered mentioning Hisaishi as an influence because &ndash; well, wasn&rsquo;t it obvious? As it turned out, not to people who hadn&rsquo;t heard him. So, while the influence of <span class="toc-counter weight2">Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Prelude&rdquo;</span> is no doubt obvious to those familiar with the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Final Fantasy</em> series&rsquo; music, I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;La fine di innocenza&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">A weird ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ment that I&rsquo;ve none&shy;the&shy;less grown quite fond of. It&rsquo;s an&shy;cient Greek (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">Ho thr&ecirc;&shy;nos t&ecirc;s Lok&shy;r&iacute;&shy;dos</em>) for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Loc&shy;ri&shy;an La&shy;ment&rdquo;</span> (more li&shy;ter&shy;al&shy;ly, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The La&shy;ment of Locris&rdquo;</span>), so named be&shy;cause it&rsquo;s writ&shy;ten, to the ex&shy;tent one can man&shy;age to do so, in the <span class="accent weight3">Loc&shy;ri&shy;an mode</span>. Of the ma&shy;jor scale&rsquo;s se&shy;ven modes, Loc&shy;ri&shy;an is the on&shy;ly one with a dim&shy;in&shy;ished root chord &ndash; thus, where its coun&shy;ter&shy;parts&rsquo; root chords are based on the con&shy;so&shy;nant in&shy;ter&shy;val of the per&shy;fect fifth, Loc&shy;ri&shy;an&rsquo;s is based on the tri&shy;tone, an in&shy;ter&shy;val <span id="ftnt_ref03" class="dotted" title="However, claims that the tritone was banned in medieval harmony or that composers or singers could be excommunciated for using it are urban legends.

		<ol class="normal fixheight">
			<li>Very few songs writ&shy;ten in Loc&shy;ri&shy;an <em>stay</em> in Loc&shy;ri&shy;an for their en&shy;ti&shy;re run&shy;ning time. This is like&shy;ly no ex&shy;cep&shy;tion.</li>

			<li>As a re&shy;sult of this, Loc&shy;rian is great for es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing not just an un&shy;sett&shy;ling at&shy;mos&shy;phere, but a sense that we&rsquo;re ne&shy;ver tru&shy;ly at &ldquo;home&rdquo;, or at least don&rsquo;t stay there for long.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">Which both feel the&shy;ma&shy;tic&shy;al&shy;ly ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate for a le&shy;vel in which an&shy;ta&shy;go&shy;nis&shy;tic al&shy;i&shy;en sla&shy;vers at&shy;tack the ship of their for&shy;mer slaves (also al&shy;i&shy;ens) and the play&shy;er helps the lat&shy;ter fight off the for&shy;mer. (This track is ten&shy;ta&shy;tive&shy;ly in&shy;ten&shy;ded for the <em class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">Tem&shy;pus Ir&shy;ae Re&shy;dux</em> level <em class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;Po&shy;ly&shy;go&shy;num op&shy;us&rdquo;</em>, which is Latin for &ldquo;po&shy;ly&shy;gon work&rdquo;.)</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">That&rsquo;s not ev&shy;en get&shy;ting in&shy;to the time sig&shy;na&shy;ture she&shy;na&shy;ni&shy;gans: the first mea&shy;sure is 1/8, the sec&shy;ond is 2/8, the third is 3/8, the fourth is 4/8, and so on, down to mea&shy;sure 21, which is 21/8. Then the cy&shy;cle re&shy;peats. So if you thought this track was in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly rhyth&shy;mic&shy;al&shy;ly dis&shy;o&shy;ri&shy;en&shy;ting&hellip; you&rsquo;re right. It is.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For all of that, this track&rsquo;s sec&shy;ond move&shy;ment is sur&shy;pri&shy;sing&shy;ly chill. Loc&shy;ri&shy;an mode is full of pa&shy;ra&shy;dox&shy;es. The first move&shy;ment is sui&shy;tab&shy;ly fran&shy;tic, but I had to work har&shy;der than I ex&shy;pec&shy;ted to get it to sound that way.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The Loc&shy;ri&shy;an mode rough&shy;ly eq&shy;uates to the an&shy;cient Greeks&rsquo; di&shy;a&shy;to&shy;nic Mi&shy;xo&shy;ly&shy;di&shy;an to&shy;nos; our Mi&shy;xo&shy;ly&shy;di&shy;an mode rough&shy;ly equ&shy;als their di&shy;a&shy;to&shy;nic Hy&shy;po&shy;phry&shy;gi&shy;an to&shy;nos. Sev&shy;er&shy;al of our oth&shy;er mode names are al&shy;so his&shy;to&shy;ric&shy;al&shy;ly in&shy;ac&shy;cu&shy;rate; I go into mu&shy;ch great&shy;er de&shy;tail <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/musicalmodes.html#etymology" class="weight3 underline songlink">on my website</a>. (I brief&shy;ly con&shy;si&shy;dered re&shy;nam&shy;ing this to some&shy;thing in&shy;vol&shy;ving &ldquo;Mi&shy;xo&shy;ly&shy;di&shy;an&rdquo;, but I quick&shy;ly el&shy;ec&shy;ted not to be&shy;cause I sus&shy;pec&shy;ted that being his&shy;to&shy;ri&shy;cal&shy;ly ac&shy;cu&shy;rate would lead to me re&shy;pea&shy;ted&shy;ly feel ob&shy;li&shy;ga&shy;ted to give TEDx talks on why our names for modes are his&shy;tor&shy;ic&shy;al&shy;ly in&shy;ac&shy;cu&shy;rate, which might&rsquo;ve an&shy;noyed me ev&shy;en more than it would&rsquo;ve an&shy;noyed ev&shy;er&shy;y&shy;one else.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This feels re&shy;la&shy;tive&shy;ly close to fin&shy;ished now. Af&shy;ter players finish the mis&shy;sion, I&rsquo;ll strip aw&shy;ay se&shy;ver&shy;al lay&shy;ers, hence the OST mix&rsquo;s sub&shy;dued out&shy;ro. (The game mix, by ne&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;ty, us&shy;es two com&shy;plete&shy;ly se&shy;par&shy;ate au&shy;di&shy;o fi&shy;les.)</p>

The guitar in the right channel quotes <a href="https://youtu.be/Nnuq9PXbywA?t=150" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">the opening of the fugue</a> from <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span>&rsquo;s famous <span class="accent weight3"><em class="weight4">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</em>, BWV 565</span>. This is actually the second time I&rsquo;ve quoted both these compositions in the same track; my <a href="https://youtu.be/bRiDh3PziWU?t=495" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">arrangement</a> of <span class="accent weight3">Alex Seropian</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>, 1994) does the same thing. I&rsquo;d like to claim that I did this on purpose, but it didn&rsquo;t occur to me until after I&rsquo;d already done it. The Bach quote, incidentally, is one of the few times I broke from strictly adhering to the scale of B Locrian &ndash; it sounded wrong without the accidentals.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&tau;&#8112;&rho;&#8112;&chi;&#974;&delta;&eta;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">tarakh&#7763;d&emacr;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">chaotic</em> in ancient Greek, while <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&#972;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">gal&emacr;n&oacute;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">peaceful</em>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Additional note for you math nerds out there: the pitch ratio of a perfect fifth is approximately 3:2, and the pitch ratio of a perfect fourth (the interval needed to complete the octave above a perfect fifth) is <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref04" title="More precisely, in twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET, the basis of modern Western instrument tuning, which uses 2^(1/12) [&asymp;1.05946309436] pitch ratios between notes), a perfect fifth&rsquo;s ratio is 2^(7/12):1 (&asymp;1.49830707688:1; cf. &sup3;&frasl;&#8322; = 1.5:1), while a perfect fourth&rsquo;s is 2^(5/12):1 (&asymp;1.33483985417; cf. 4/3 = 1.333333&hellip;:1). 12-TET very likely became standard because it&rsquo;s the smallest equal temperament that so closely approximates 3:2 and 4:3, which have been considered fundamental ratios of musical harmony at least since Pythagoras&rsquo; day.">approximately 4:3.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt04" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8308;&#8318;</a></span> The tritone, meanwhile, has a ratio of exactly &radic;<span class="radical-number">2</span>:1.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Finally, a few notes on <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span> (undoubtedly still my biggest musical influence): this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565#Reception" target="_blank">Wikipedia paragraph</a> on <em class="toc-counter weight2">Toc&shy;cata and Fugue in D minor</em>&rsquo;s reception might as well open <span class="accent weight3">Charles Dic&shy;kens</span>&rsquo; <em class="accent weight3">A Tale of Two Cities</em>:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight toc-counter">&ldquo;The composition has been deemed both &lsquo;particularly suited to the organ&rsquo; and &lsquo;strikingly unorganistic&rsquo;. It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, but also as containing &lsquo;passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea&rsquo;. It has been called &lsquo;entirely a thing of virtuosity&rsquo; yet also described as being &lsquo;not so difficult as it sounds&rsquo;. It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, but also as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm. It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style. Its period of origin has been assumed to have been as early as around 1704, and as late as the 1750s. Its defining characteristics have been associated with extant compositions by Bach (BWV 531, 549a, 578, 911, 914, 922 and several of the solo violin sonatas and partitas), and by others (including Nicolaus Bruhns and Johann Heinrich Buttstett), as well as with untraceable earlier versions for other instruments and/or by other composers. It has been deemed too simplistic for it to have been written down by Bach, and too much a stroke of genius to have been composed by anyone else but Bach.&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight"><del style="text-decoration-thickness: 0.5px;">In short, it was a composition very much like present-d</del> I&rsquo;m sorry; I can&rsquo;t even type that with a straight face.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, I&rsquo;ve performed the toccata in its entirety on both piano and pipe organ and didn&rsquo;t find it especially difficult (this was 25 years ago, so I don&rsquo;t have a recording; sorry). I also find it far too ingenious to <em>not</em> be by Bach, but then, I was taught <span class="accent weight3">Christian Petzold</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" id="ftnt_ref05" title="Performance by Lang Lang (Chinese: &#37070;&#26391;; pinyin: L&aacute;ng L&#462;ng); also includes Petzold&rsquo;s less famous Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115, which is part of a pair with BWV Anh. 114, and which I think I actually like more. Lang also comments on why both minuets are works of genius, and why they&rsquo;re such fantastic pieces for beginners to learn.  &para;  BWV Anh. stands for &ldquo;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis Anhang&rdquo;, German for &ldquo;Bach-Works-Catalogue Annex&rdquo;, &ldquo;a list of lost, doubtful, or spurious compositions by, or once attributed to, Johann Sebastian Bach&rdquo; (Wikipedia)."><span class="accent weight3"><a href="https://youtu.be/hw19cy5bV6E" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Minuet in G</a>,</span> <span lang="de-de">BWV Anh. 114</span>,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt05" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8309;&#8318;</a></span> as a Bach piece and was shocked to learn the attribution to Bach was spurious (and was known to be when I was taught it &ndash; pedagogy took a long time to catch up with scholarship). Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/AOZOnJS-vKE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">brief but solid overview</a> of why Petzold&rsquo;s work was misattributed for so long (followed by a lovely acoustic guitar performance). <span class="dotted" title="Spanish for &ldquo;Turn on closed captions if you don&rsquo;t understand Spanish.&rdquo;" lang="es-us">Enciende subt&iacute;tulos cerrados si no entiendes espa&ntilde;ol.</span> (<span class="dotted" title="Spanish for &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;I regret it&rdquo;)" lang="es-us">Lo siento</span>; turn on closed captions if you don&rsquo;t understand Spanish.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use the chaotic version of this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> levels <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Repository Four&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Polygonum opus&rdquo;</span>, before you complete the mission; the latter will switch to the calm variant, which I also intend to use on other repository levels (except <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The End&rdquo;</span>).</p>

		<p class="fixheight toc-counter centred">composer: <span class="accent weight3">Aaron Freed</span>, 2024</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I stole this song&rsquo;s rhythm from <span class="accent weight3">the Allman Brothers Band</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span> (studio: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/nfrSIUE3iAE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Allman Brothers Band</a></em>, 1969; definitive live recording: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/4ppYldfTMiE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">At Fillmore East</a></em>, 1971), likely the most famous use of 11/8 in rock history (despite its composer <span class="toc-counter weight2">Gregg Allman</span> <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref06" title="Per the man himself: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t feel one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes. &hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rdquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rdquo; Duane just said, &ldquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rdquo;&rsquo;  &para;  (Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly wrong, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)">apparently not understanding this<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt06" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8310;&#8318;</a></span>), so if it feels slightly off-kilter rhythmically, that&rsquo;s entirely intentional. A few of its chords may be similar to those of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span>, too. Another big influence is undoubtedly <span class="accent weight3">Led Zeppelin</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight2">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/w772GXG5LnE" target="_blank" class="underlin songlink">Dazed and Confused</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Led Zeppelin</em>, 1969).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">However, it sounds quite different from either &ndash; despite the fairly metal-influenced (synthesized) guitar solo towards the end, it has a major jazz fusion/progressive electronic vibe, despite paradoxically having virtually no blue notes and sticking fairly strictly to the <span class="toc-counter weight2">D Dorian</span> scale. It&rsquo;s also quite a bit more unpredictable and even chaotic than what I set out to make. A friend described it as sounding like <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> boss fight music, which feels entirely accurate. My mother also compared it to <span class="accent weight3">Tears for Fears</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Sowing the Seeds of Love&rdquo;</span> (album mix: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/XEQKy8g5UK4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Seeds of Love</a></em>, 1989; the <a href="https://youtu.be/VAtGOESO7W8" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">music video</a> is a minute shorter), which also feels accurate (<em class="toc-counter weight2">The Seeds of Love</em>, a lost classic of the late &rsquo;80s, has been one of my favorite albums for 35 years).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The title (Italian for &ldquo;Portrait in Gray&rdquo;) is a pun on the Dorian mode by way of <span class="accent weight3">Oscar Wilde</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> &ndash; a sort of song title equivalent of Cockney rhyming slang.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I feel almost certain that I&rsquo;ll write at least one more movement of this track (perhaps preceding the first one, perhaps following the last), and I have absolutely no idea where it&rsquo;s going. I&rsquo;ve had it suggested to me to use an ABB&rsquo;A&rsquo; structure for this track, which I&rsquo;m currently contemplating; if I do so, it&rsquo;ll be entirely safe to wager money on me throwing in at least one brief reference to <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Mamma Mia!&rdquo;</span> or some other <span class="accent weight3">ABBA</span> banger. (<span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Mamma Mia!&rdquo;</span> is the likeliest due to its Italian title.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Theatre of Pain&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I actually began writing this track before all others on this album except &ldquo;Not Actually FFIV&rdquo; and &ldquo;7:6:5:4&rdquo;, but it didn&rsquo;t actually turn into a <em>song</em> until significantly later. It is still, in fact, nowhere near done.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">&ldquo;Danza frattale&rdquo; (Italian for &ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo;) evolved from a mathematical pattern, hence the name.

I ar&shy;ranged these into chords and threw a disco beat and bass line over them. It goes kinda hard, tbh. About mid&shy;way through, &ldquo;Danza frattale&rdquo; switches to 5/4 without actually becoming any less disco (see above for further experiments in this).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The &ldquo;Danza frattale&rdquo; guitar solo remains a work in progress, but it quotes <span class="accent weight3">Edvard Grieg</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;In the Hall of the Mountain King&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Peer Gynt</em>, 1875), very likely the most famous Norwegian composition in history and &ndash; more to the point &ndash; the most famous use of a continually increasing tempo in musical history. For that exact reason, I did something unexpected: I slowed down the second half of my quote. (This was partly to fit the existing chord progression, but it was also pure contrarianism.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">While mixing &ldquo;Danza frattale&rdquo;, its solo keyboard parts captivated me enough to isolate them and make them the central part of a new track, named &ldquo;Jazz frattale&rdquo; for obvious reasons (though it also wouldn&rsquo;t feel out-of-place in a late-&rsquo;90s/early-&rsquo;00s JRPG soundtrack). For the OST, I&rsquo;ve merged them into a single track; in-game, &ldquo;Danza frattale&rdquo; will crossfade into &ldquo;Jazz frattale&rdquo; once the platforms necessary to escape the level are all active. (I may also require all the Juggernauts to be dead for the transition to occur.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Game of Death&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Another work in progress. I wrote most of it while Hurricane Debby was passing overhead. Logic Pro&rsquo;s Latin percussionist, which I used on this track, has a preset called &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo;; the title was predestined, though as with many others, I translated it to Italian for the first movement, which also gives us a nice pun. (For the second, I translated it to Spanish, owing to the whole piece&rsquo;s substantial Latin jazz influence.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Overall, this is an experiment in tonality. Several tracks above deviate from the diatonic scale&rsquo;s modes rarely, if ever; here, in an effort to seesaw between harmony and exceeding Loc&shy;ri&shy;an&rsquo;s dissonance, I took a more chromatic approach. It&rsquo;s too early to know if I&rsquo;ve succeeded, but the results seem promising.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Towel Boy&rdquo;</span>; as players progress through the level, we&rsquo;ll add new instruments, then once the Juggernaut dies, we&rsquo;ll switch to the jazz version.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I may be the only person that actually hears this, but this song is vaguely inspired by <span class="accent weight3">System of a Down</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/CSvFpBOe8eY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">Chop Suey!</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Toxicity</em>, 2001). The biggest tells are that, like its inspiration, it&rsquo;s in G minor and makes heavy use of start-stop dynamics. (It&rsquo;s also titled after a recurring line from &ldquo;Chop Suey!&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s one of the few <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> track titles I haven&rsquo;t translated into a foreign language because neither Italian nor Latin have split infinitives.) It turned into something quite different, though.</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">The other vague inspiration I can name is <span class="accent weight3">Radiohead</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Q29iibXXiOs" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">In Limbo</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Kid A</em>, 2000), another song that lives rent-free in my head (actually, most of that album does). Whenever I hear a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Fender Rhodes</span> play a fuguelike melody, that song immediately comes to mind.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I didn&rsquo;t even try to make the jazz arrangement of this song similar to the metal version, apart from its chord progression &ndash; in fact, they have no instrument parts in common. In this case, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem: the transitions within the metal movement are meant to be jarring, so why shouldn&rsquo;t the transition to jazz <em>also</em> come out of nowhere?</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This may be this collection&rsquo;s furthest track from being finished, but it&rsquo;ll likely remain the shortest track I write for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em>; stretching it out too long would spoil the effect. I&rsquo;m already pleased enough with it to include it, in any case. I&rsquo;ll likely use it for a short secret level like <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Beyond the Black&rdquo;</span>.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This track ex&shy;ists al&shy;most en&shy;ti&shy;re&shy;ly be&shy;cause Chris per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me to make it. I&rsquo;m not sure I can ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly ex&shy;press how mean&shy;ing&shy;ful and re&shy;war&shy;ding that is to me.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">A few days be&shy;fore I be&shy;gan wor&shy;king on this track, I&rsquo;d sent him a mash-up I&rsquo;d made of <span class="accent weight3">wow&shy;bob&shy;wow</span>&rsquo;s ar&shy;range&shy;ment of <span class="accent weight3">Al&shy;ex Se&shy;ro&shy;pi&shy;an</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/dcWHHYsoNk8?t=849" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">Lan&shy;ding</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em>, 1994) with Chris&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/EGXPAoyP_cg" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Rain For&shy;mer&shy;ly Known as Pur&shy;ple</a>&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/RffBrCLOKv0" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">A Gla&shy;cier E&shy;ven&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly Farts (and Don&rsquo;t You Lis&shy;ten to the Song of Life)</a>.&rdquo;</span> (Chris&rsquo; song ti&shy;tle game puts mine to shame.) Chris liked it and pro&shy;vi&shy;ded se&shy;ve&shy;ral con&shy;struc&shy;tive sug&shy;ges&shy;tions that I&rsquo;m sure will im&shy;prove the song im&shy;mense&shy;ly the next time I get around to wor&shy;king on it. I also men&shy;tioned that I wan&shy;ted to at&shy;tempt a few further mash-ups; he seemed to find that idea mo&shy;der&shy;ate&shy;ly in&shy;ter&shy;es&shy;ting, but he di&shy;rect&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me to try to write some&shy;thing en&shy;tire&shy;ly new based on the OST stems. (Just the fact that he re&shy;leased the OST stems at all is awe&shy;some, I have to add.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;d con&shy;si&shy;dered that idea se&shy;ve&shy;ral times be&shy;fore then, and ev&shy;e&shy;ry time I&rsquo;d done so, I&rsquo;d felt too in&shy;ti&shy;mi&shy;da&shy;ted to try. But since Chris had per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me, I put that a&shy;side and load&shy;ed four stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/eQyP7qocptY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky</a>&rdquo;</span> in&shy;to Logic: the lead me&shy;lo&shy;dy, the drum and per&shy;cus&shy;sion tracks, and the bass guitar. I then at&shy;temp&shy;ted to write my own chords and ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ni&shy;ment and was shocked at:</p>

				<ol class="loweralpha normal fixheight">
					<li>how na&shy;tu&shy;ral&shy;ly I came up with sub&shy;stan&shy;tial&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent chords for most of the me&shy;lo&shy;dy</li>
					<li>how com&shy;plete&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent its mood felt</li>
					<li>how in&shy;com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sib&shy;ly sub&shy;lime the result felt</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="fixheight">To be fair, part of this is be&shy;cause Chris&rsquo; work is on another level. (I al&shy;rea&shy;dy men&shy;tioned in an end&shy;note for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Not Ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly FFIV&rdquo;</span> that <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is now tied with <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="kanji: &#26893;&#26494; &#20280;&#22827;; hiragana: &#12358;&#12360;&#12414;&#12388; &#12398;&#12406;&#12362;; r&omacr;maji: Uematsu Nobuo">No&shy;bu&shy;o U&shy;e&shy;mat&shy;su</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Japanese: &#x5996;&#x661F;&#x4E71;&#x821E; (Y&omacr;sei Ranbu), literally &ldquo;Wild Dance of the Ominous Star&rdquo;">&ldquo;Dan&shy;cing Mad&rdquo;</span> as my fa&shy;vor&shy;ite piece ever writ&shy;ten for a vi&shy;de&shy;o game.)</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I did find my&shy;self stumped when I got to what, for lack of a bet&shy;ter word, I&rsquo;ll call the break&shy;down about four min&shy;utes into the piece. I&rsquo;ve ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly co&shy;pied the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;al chords, be&shy;cause ev&shy;en af&shy;ter trans&shy;crib&shy;ing the me&shy;lo&shy;dy and har&shy;mo&shy;ny for that seg&shy;ment by ear, the the&shy;o&shy;ry be&shy;hind it con&shy;founds me. Every chord I&rsquo;ve tried there be&shy;sides the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;als has felt com&shy;plete&shy;ly off. I don&rsquo;t un&shy;der&shy;stand how or why it works, but the re&shy;so&shy;lu&shy;tion it provides, both in Chris&rsquo; original and in my va&shy;ri&shy;a&shy;tion, is off the charts &ndash; which is es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly re&shy;mar&shy;kab&shy;le be&shy;cause, un&shy;til it hits, nei&shy;ther piece even feels like it&rsquo;s been buil&shy;ding ten&shy;sion.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve also tweaked the notes of the original song&rsquo;s bass line. I&rsquo;m actually quite proud of this &ndash; in particular, I managed to change the interval between a pair of connected notes at around 4:24 in a way that sounded natural. This actually takes some rather precise sound editing &ndash; I wound up cross-fading quickly between a version pitch-shifted up three half-steps and a version pitch-shifted up four half-steps.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This move&shy;ment&rsquo;s ti&shy;tle (if I haven&rsquo;t made any mis&shy;takes, which is quite pos&shy;si&shy;ble) is An&shy;cient Greek (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Ho z&iacute;n&shy;gos a&uacute;x&shy;e&shy;tai m&eacute;&shy;gas&rdquo;</em>) for <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;The Whir&shy;ring Grows Loud&rdquo;</span>, the phrase <em class="weight3 accent">Risk of Rain 2</em> dis&shy;plays just be&shy;fore the op&shy;tion&shy;al boss <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Al&shy;loy Wor&shy;ship Un&shy;it</span> spawns (which, in the un&shy;mod&shy;ded base game, on&shy;ly ev&shy;er oc&shy;curs on <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Si&shy;ren&rsquo;s Call</span>, one of the two sta&shy;ges that plays <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span>).</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This tran&shy;si&shy;tion is jar&shy;ring, and I&rsquo;m not ev&shy;en sure I want to fix it. In fact, I&rsquo;m fair&shy;ly sure I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a ma&shy;jor e&shy;mo&shy;tion&shy;al shift be&shy;tween these two move&shy;ments, and I think it&rsquo;s even more ef&shy;fec&shy;tive if it&rsquo;s sud&shy;den.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve experimented before with <span class="weight3 accent">Frank Zappa</span>&rsquo;s concept of <span class="accent weight3">xenochrony</span> (from <em class="toc-counter weight2">ξένος</em> [<em class="toc-counter weight2">x&eacute;nos</em>; <em class="toc-counter weight2">strange, alien</em>] and <em class="toc-counter weight2">χρόνος</em> [<em class="toc-counter weight2">khr&oacute;nos</em>; <em class="toc-counter weight2">time</em>]; thus, <em>strange time</em>), wherein a musical part is extracted outside its original context in one song and placed in another (which <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Zappa</span> claimed was the only way to achieve certain rhythmic effects). Good examples include <em class="accent weight3">Eternal</em>&rsquo;s extended <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Flippant&rdquo;</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> remixes and the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>/<em class="toc-counter weight2">Risk of Rain 2</em> mash-up I mentioned in my commentary for movement &alpha; of this very track. But I think this is the furthest I&rsquo;ve taken the concept to date.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">From the very start, I&rsquo;d intended this move&shy;ment to mash up mul&shy;ti&shy;ple <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em> songs. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to fur&shy;ther <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> stems (i.e., the vocals), I worked in some stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/VTJcLE_VVX8" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">They Might as Well Be Dead</a>&rdquo;</span> that, after I pitch-shif&shy;ted them from D mi&shy;nor to C mi&shy;nor and slowed it from 100 to 88 bpm, dove&shy;tailed beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly with the for&shy;mer song&rsquo;s syn&shy;the&shy;si&shy;zer so&shy;lo, <span id="ftnt_ref07" class="dotted" title="Translator&rsquo;s note: &lsquo;keikaku&rsquo; means &lsquo;plan&rsquo;.  &para;  (In case you were curious, &ldquo;keikaku d&omacr;ri&rdquo;, the source of the memetic &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo;, is written in kanji as &#x300C;計画 通り&#x300D; or &#x300C;計劃 通り&#x300D; and in hiragana as &#x300C;けいかく どおり&#x300D;.)">just according to <em>keikaku</em><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt07" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8311;&#8318;</a>.</span> (<span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly 110 bpm, but it&rsquo;s also 5/4, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is 4/4; thus, lin&shy;ing the meas&shy;ures up re&shy;qui&shy;res mak&shy;ing the lat&shy;ter&rsquo;s tem&shy;po 80% of the for&shy;mer&rsquo;s.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">But while I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted the two songs to fit to&shy;geth&shy;er, I was ab&shy;so&shy;lute&shy;ly flab&shy;ber&shy;gas&shy;ted at <em>how well</em> they fit. I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted to have to fi&shy;nag&shy;le the har&shy;mo&shy;ny of the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> segments at least a lit&shy;tle bit, but my in&shy;stincts had been dead-on: ev&shy;e&shy;ry&shy;thing fit per&shy;fect&shy;ly as soon as I lined it up. It&rsquo;s not that the chord pro&shy;gres&shy;sions are i&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;cal &ndash; far from it, in fact. The me&shy;lo&shy;dy of Chris&rsquo; solo in the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> simp&shy;ly hap&shy;pens to work per&shy;fect&shy;ly over the chords from the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">Since that worked so well, I also added stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/LEUwTBWkeas" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">Mois&shy;ture De&shy;fi&shy;cit</a>&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/81QhAo3hLrM" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by</a>&rdquo;</span>. <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Moisture Deficit&rdquo;</span> was ob&shy;vi&shy;ous: <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is a re&shy;make of it. Most of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by&rdquo;</span>&rsquo;s stems al&shy;so fit flawlessly, but <span class="accent weight3">Kal&shy;li&shy;o&shy;pi Mit&shy;ro&shy;pou&shy;lou</span>&rsquo;s harmonies are slightly out of phase with the other songs&rsquo; chord progressions during the climax &ndash; which I like, since the sensation of something being out of place feels appropriate for a game wherein alien slavers attack Renaissance Italy.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This movement contains some complex polyrhythms: <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Raindrop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is in 5/8, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is in 4/4. <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Moisture Deficit&rdquo;</span> switches between 7/4, 4/4, and 5/4, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Once in a Lullaby&rdquo;</span> uses 4/2 and 7/4, according to the PDF included with the stems. This gives us 5:4, 7:4, and 7:5 polyrhythms in places, though 5:4 is the most prominent by far. Most of this song predominantly feels like 5/8, but once the drums from <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> dominate the mix (starting at 9:51), it predominantly feels like 4/4. (For the record, I notated everything as 5/8.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This ti&shy;tle (again, if I haven&rsquo;t made any er&shy;rors) is Ancient Greek (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Ho&shy;ne&shy;i&shy;ro&shy;po&shy;le&shy;&iacute;s t&ecirc;s bi&shy;a&iacute;&shy;&amacr;s aux&shy;&iacute;&shy;se&shy;os&rdquo;</em>) for <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;You Dream of Vi&shy;ol&shy;ent Growth&rdquo;</span>, the phrase <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain 2</em> dis&shy;plays if you use the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Lu&shy;nar Seer</span> to force <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Sun&shy;dered Grove</span> (the stage that plays <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>) to spawn as the next stage.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;m not totally sure I&rsquo;ve gotten the grammar right &ndash; in fact, I&rsquo;ve already changed it twice. I first incorrectly used the uncontracted form of the verb (<em>-έεις</em> instead of <em>-εῖς</em>); then I used &laquo;Ὀνειροπολεῖς τῆς βῐαίᾱς αὐξήσεος&raquo;, which uses the Koine genitivecase for the noun phrase &lsquo;violent growth&rdquo;, since genitive is the equivalent of an English possessive, i.e., &ldquo;of violent growth&rdquo;. (I specifically chose Koine declensions because New Testament Greek&rsquo;s dialect felt thematically appropriate for the level with the most memorable cathedral ever constructed in the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> engine.) However, further research indicated that <em>ὀνειροπολέω</em> (<em>oneiropol&eacute;o</em>) already means <em>I dream of</em>; thus, I changed the noun phrase to use the accusative case (the equivalent of an English direct object). I&rsquo;m still not sure this is correct; finding credible English-language sources on ancient Greek grammar is quite difficult.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This probably won&rsquo;t be the fi&shy;nal track in this col&shy;lec&shy;tion when it&rsquo;s fin&shy;ished &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m done wri&shy;ting songs for <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> yet, though I only plan to continue until approximately 2024-09-21 (an arbitrary date that I&rsquo;ve selected partly because it&rsquo;s the autumn equinox and partly due to that <strong>Earth, Wind & Fire</strong> song &ndash; you know the one).</p>

				<blockquote class="toc-counter">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes.&hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rsquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rsquo; Duane just said, &lsquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote>
			
				(Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly <em>wrong</em>, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)
