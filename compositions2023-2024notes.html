<p class="fixheight">This is a (still un&shy;fin&shy;ished) col&shy;lec&shy;tion of tracks I&rsquo;ve writ&shy;ten (or, in one case, cowritten) for game sound&shy;tracks since 2023. They&rsquo;re cur&shy;rent&shy;ly all in&shy;ten&shy;ded ei&shy;ther for <em class="accent weight3">hell&shy;pak Vol. 2</em> or <em class="accent weight3 dotted" lang="la" title="Latin, literally meaning &ldquo;Time of Wrath Returned&rdquo;. Obligatory Latin pedantry: &ldquo;returned&rdquo; is a participle modifying &rdquo;time&rdquo; (this is syntactically clear due to &ldquo;&imacr;rae&rdquo; being the only word of the title in the genitive case); also, the &lsquo;I&rsquo; is a long vowel (i.e., if using macrons to stand in for apices, we&rsquo;d have &ldquo;Tempus &Imacr;rae Redux&rdquo;). Now cross off a square on your bingo cards.">Tem&shy;pus Irae Re&shy;dux</em>, which are both forth&shy;com&shy;ing third-par&shy;ty sce&shy;na&shy;ri&shy;os for <span class="accent weight3">Bun&shy;gie</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em> se&shy;ries, though I don&rsquo;t know for sure where they&rsquo;ll end up.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Any me&shy;di&shy;a play&shy;er worth its salt can read the in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;du&shy;al songs within the images; I also pro&shy;vide cue&shy;sheets to split all three versions into their com&shy;pon&shy;ent move&shy;ments, and to split both disc images into songs.</p>

<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ll probably grant most noncommercial uses for other tracks if asked; I&rsquo;d just like to know who&rsquo;s using it and why. (I may even al&shy;low com&shy;mer&shy;cial use if of&shy;fered fair com&shy;pen&shy;sa&shy;tion, though per&shy;mis&shy;sion for track 11 is not mine to grant.)

<p class="fixheight noprint">I link to You&shy;Tube vi&shy;de&shy;os of most songs I men&shy;tion by oth&shy;er ar&shy;tists.

<p class="fixheight">The &ldquo;DR&rdquo; scores mea&shy;sure songs&rsquo; overall dynamic range via the <a href="https://foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_dr_meter" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink" target="_blank">TT Dy&shy;nam&shy;ic Range Me&shy;ter</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;foobar2000<span class="breaker">.</span>org<span class="breaker">/</span>components<span class="breaker">/</span>view<span class="breaker">/</span>foo<span class="breaker">_</span>dr<span class="breaker">_</span>meter&#10217;</span> plug&shy;in for <span class="weight3 accent">foo&shy;bar&shy;2000</span>. High&shy;er scores correlate to higher dy&shy;nam&shy;ic range. (This doesn&rsquo;t universally correlate to better sound quality, but low dynamic range can cause listener fatigue, especially on head&shy;phones.) Modern popular music often scores in the DR5&ndash;DR7 range; thus, this al&shy;bum is both more dy&shy;nam&shy;ic and qui&shy;e&shy;ter. Use your vol&shy;ume knob if ne&shy;ces&shy;sa&shy;ry.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Lastly, the predominance of Italian and Latin song titles is a direct result of <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>&rsquo;s Italian setting. I left a few direct references to other works in English (the isolated phrase &ldquo;you wanted to&rdquo; is literally, not figuratively, untranslatable to Italian or Latin, neither of which has split infinitives, while any translations I could formulate of &ldquo;co-starring&rdquo; to either language were infuriatingly wordy), and I titled one movement in Spanish, one track in French, and two tracks in (very likely ungrammatical) Greek for reasons explained below, but titling most of them in Italian or Latin felt appropriate.</p>

	<p>Many of my favorite game composers were working against the limits of their era&rsquo;s technology. This forced them to exercise a form of creativity that otherwise would&rsquo;ve been absent. You see, I feel <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Russian: Игорь Фёдорович Стравинский; romanized: Igor&rsquo; Fyodorovich Stravinskiy">Igor Stravinsky</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3 dotted" title="French: Po&eacute;tique musicale sous forme de six le&ccedil;ons">Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons</em> expresses an unassailable truth about the creative process:</p>

	<blockquote id="stravinsky" class="toc-counter">
		<p>&ldquo;I have no use for a theoretic freedom. Let me have something finite, definite &ndash; matter that can lend itself to my operation only insofar as it is commensurate with my possibilities. And such matter presents itself to me together with limitations. I must in turn impose mine upon it.</p>

		<p>So here we are, whether we like it or not, in the realm of necessity. And yet which of us has ever heard talk of art as other than a realm of freedom? This sort of heresy is uniformly widespread because it is imagined that art is outside the bounds of ordinary activity.</p>
		
		<p>Well, in art as in everything else, one can build only upon a resisting foundation: whatever constantly gives way to pressure, constantly renders movement impossible. My freedom thus consists in my moving about within the narrow frame that I have assigned myself for each one of my undertakings.</p>
		
		<p>I shall go even further: my freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I surround myself with obstacles. Whatever diminishes constraint, diminishes strength. The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one&rsquo;s self of the chains that shackle the spirit.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>I am in no place to argue with a composer of such importance, whose works I am only beginning to understand. Unfortunately (or not), the era in which I am composing no longer imposes such restrictions upon video game music; in fact, I live in an era where synthesized DAWs can create often tolerable recreations of guitars, a feat I couldn&rsquo;t even have imagined in 1997, the last time I&rsquo;d seriously composed new music.</p>

	<p>I therefore self-imposed many other restrictions instead. Some were fairly simple: &ldquo;Write a pastiche of one of my favorite composers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Base a song on a mathematical pattern.&rdquo; Some were more complicated: &ldquo;Use Phrygian mode and several time signatures,&rdquo; &ldquo;Use Locrian mode and change time signatures every measure.&rdquo; And I don&rsquo;t even understand how I pulled this one off: &ldquo;Write a pastiche of a song I&rsquo;ve only heard once.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>This resulted in several forms of experimentation I doubt I&rsquo;d have otherwise engaged in &ndash; and I suspect that restricting individual tracks&rsquo; content paradoxically made this album far more diverse overall. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">While writing this movement, I briefly thought I&rsquo;d rewritten <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Main Theme of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>&rdquo;</span>; then I played it back and realized I hadn&rsquo;t, which resulted in this song&rsquo;s admittedly bizarre title. At this point, writing a pastiche of <span class="weight3 accent">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s music felt inevitable, so I leaned into it and gave what became its three movements cheeky titles based on their obvious inspirations.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Since I hadn&rsquo;t fully settled on this being a <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> pastiche when I wrote it, this movement probably has the most distinct identity. Despite its relative melodic and harmonic simplicity, its arrangement goes through several major changes that hopefully will keep it engaging. The transition at the end is probably this movement&rsquo;s most complicated and unexpected aspect.</p>

			<p>Believe it or not, I merely intended this to be a study in 5:4 polyrhythms (which are distinct from, though in this case coincidentally linked to, 5/4 time signatures). However, the bassline I wrote for the first movement steadfastly refused to work in anything except groups of seven<span class="noprint"> (<a href="https://marathon.bungie.org/story/seven.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">yes Hamish</a>)</span>; the <a href="https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">Oblique Strategies</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;stoney<span class="breaker">.</span>sb<span class="breaker">.</span>org<span class="breaker">/</span>eno<span class="breaker">/</span>oblique<span class="breaker">.</span>html&#10217;</span> suggested keeping it that way, so I began this song with the extraordinarily unusual 7:5 polyrhythm. Groups of six and four naturally worked their way in as I wrote additional instrument parts, hence the song&rsquo;s title.</p>
		
			<p>For those curious, I actually notated this as 4/4 in Logic, so much like <span class="toc-counter weight2">Meshuggah</span>, I could truthfully claim the mind-warping polyrhythms I&rsquo;ve created here are entirely in 4/4. However, time signatures are really products of <em>feeling</em> rather than of mathematics, and I don&rsquo;t actually <em>feel</em> this song as 4/4; I usually feel it either as 5/4 or as 7/4, depending on whether I&rsquo;m focusing more on the drums or the bass.</p>

					<p>I hadn&rsquo;t planned on writing a blues track here, but I soon realized harmonic simplicity served ideally to introduce such extraordinary rhythmic complexity. (While neither usually work in what we could call blues idioms, I was effectively following <span class="toc-counter weight2">Tool</span> and <span class="toc-counter weight2">Meshuggah</span>&rsquo;s examples in this regard.)</p>
					
					<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in concealing my influences, so I quoted <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> and &ldquo;Those Who Fight Further&rdquo;</span> for eighteen seconds each near the end of this movement because I felt I&rsquo;d been melodically aping them throughout it.</p>

					<p>The Mellotron introduces this new movement&rsquo;s chords before the bass enters, followed by the organ and two different guitar parts. The bass line repeatedly suggests <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Chomber&rdquo;</span> from <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> &ndash; since I was writing this for a <em>Marathon</em> scenario and had by this point settled on using groupings of seven for the bass parts throughout the entire track, the reference felt obligatory.

					<p>Guitar and bass rarely engage in counterpoint in rock music. I love counterpoint and would love to hear more of it, so I wrote the guitar part as a counterpoint to the bass line. I&rsquo;m extremely pleased with the effect; it almost sounds like a rock fugue.</p>

					<p>Midway through this movement, I add strings and some ethereal <em class="weight3 accent">Dark Side of the Moon</em>-style choral vocals that end up being the song&rsquo;s final elements as the others stop playing. (Before adding the strings, I&rsquo;d begun writing a fourth movement that I yeeted after noticing that it was virtually identical to <span class="weight3 accent">Chris Christodoulou</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/67BwWgrMlxk" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Coalescence</a>&rdquo;</span> [<em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em>, 2013].)</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve never played a <em class="accent weight3">Donkey Kong Country</em> game and, to my knowledge, hadn&rsquo;t heard any of its brilliant music until <span class="dotted" title="June 11, 2024, in ISO 8601 (the objectively correct date format)">2024-06-11</span>. I note this because any <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> fan will immediately peg <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> as an unapologetic tribute to its most famous track, <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. (Right down to its title, in fact: <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> is Latin for <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. I see little point in concealing my influences.)</p>

			<p>I grew up listening to <span class="accent weight3">David Wise</span>&rsquo;s music; I played the NES <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marble Madness</em> ad nauseam as a child, plus <em class="toc-counter weight2">California Games</em> and likely <em class="toc-counter weight2">Battletoads</em> and maybe a few other games he worked on as well. But Wise&rsquo;s reputation primarily rests on his <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> soundtracks, and with good reason: they use the <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>&rsquo;s limited sound chip as virtuosically as <span class="toc-counter weight2">Square</span>&rsquo;s greatest 16-bit composers (<span class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" title="kanji: &#33738;&#30000; &#35029;&#27193;; hiragana: &#12365;&#12367;&#12383; &#12402;&#12429;&#12365;; r&omacr;maji: Kikuta Hiroki.

They&rsquo;d be the absolute upper echelon in this category if <span class="toc-counter weight2">Tim &amp; Geoff Follin</span> hadn&rsquo;t existed &ndash; on which note, R.I.P. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Geoff</span> :(</p>

			<p>I first heard <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> in a <a href="https://youtu.be/4DgPmI6S_So" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">video</a> jazz pianist <span class="toc-counter weight2">Charles Cornell</span> ostensibly made about <span class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" title="kanji: &#36817;&#34276; &#28009;&#27835;; hiragana: &#12371;&#12435;&#12393;&#12358; &#12371;&#12358;&#12376;; r&omacr;maji: Kond&omacr; K&omacr;ji">K&omacr;ji Kond&omacr;</span>&rsquo;s (also brilliant) music for <em class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" title="Katakana: スーパーマリオ６４; r&omacr;maji: S&umacr;p&amacr; Mario 64">Super Mario 64</em>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Dire, Dire Docks&rdquo;</span>. Cornell actually spent more than half its runtime gushing about Wise&rsquo;s track, and I immediately understood why; it struck a nerve on a primal level. Not only did I know, on first listen, that it was a masterpiece, but I immediately wanted to write a more energetic track with an otherwise similar mood &ndash; which is not an urge I frequently get.</p>

			<p>So, having heard Wise&rsquo;s piece probably no more than twice, I sat down and put its first two chords (which Cornell had analyzed in detail) into <span class="toc-counter weight2">Logic Pro</span>&rsquo;s arpeggiator. Overnight, going entirely by what felt natural, I wrote chords, melodies, and a basic arrangement; I already had a rough mix by sunrise of 2024-06-12. I&rsquo;ve since added a few background embellishments, but its fundaments are unchanged.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s rare (get it? because <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">developer</a> is&hellip;<span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;en<span class="breaker">.</span>wikipedia<span class="breaker">.</span>org<span class="breaker">/</span>wiki<span class="breaker">/</span>Rare<span class="breaker">_</span>(company)&#10217;</span> never mind) for a song to emerge almost fully formed so quickly for me; usually, <em>something</em> about my first attempt doesn&rsquo;t work, but this (if you&rsquo;ll allow an obvious water metaphor) just flowed out as an expression of my contemporary emotional and mental state. I felt particularly alienated by certain individuals within the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> community: one of my closest friends (who&rsquo;s seriously ill) had poured eighteen months into tutoring me for seemingly fruitless ends. (I&rsquo;ve withheld names and further specifics to protect the <del>innocent</del> guilty, but we ultimately <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-Bet-Marathon/alephbet" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">forked the engine</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;github<span class="breaker">.</span>com<span class="breaker">/</span>Aleph-Bet-Marathon<span class="breaker">/</span>alephbet&#10217;</span>.) Reading this song as a reflection of the existential despair I felt at the time is not strictly incorrect.</p>

			<p><span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> is obviously one of the best game tracks of all time, and in no way do I think I&rsquo;ve duplicated its quality &ndash; especially because, again, Wise was doing all of that on a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>! To avoid plagiarism (<a href="https://youtu.be/UQHaGhC7C2E" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">a famous Russian mathematician&rsquo;s advice</a> aside), I didn&rsquo;t listen to Wise&rsquo;s piece again until I finished writing mine &ndash; and when I did, I was pretty astonished at how closely I&rsquo;d approximated its mood and atmosphere. But I can hardly consider myself an unbiased source, so I&rsquo;ll quote one of my early listeners:</p>

			<blockquote class="toc-counter">&ldquo;I think you really captured the spirit of the OG while still giving it a danceable (beat, rhythm, etc. &ndash; not sure on the vocab). It&rsquo;s got more energy than the source material :)&rdquo;</blockquote>

			<p>So I&rsquo;ll chalk that one up as a success.</p>
			
			<p>This track will play on the <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Gauntlet&rdquo;</span>.</p>

I&rsquo;d already relied heavily on the session drummer in my previous arrangements &ndash; I&rsquo;m not a drummer, and whenever I write drum parts myself, they feel less natural to me than the parts I&rsquo;ve created with Logic&rsquo;s session drummer. The bassist is even better than that.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Logic&rsquo;s session players all require substantial user input to get the kinds of performances found here; users must, at the bare minimum, specify chords and performance styles. There are also parameters for the rhythmic patterns the session players use; the complexity, intensity, and dynamic range of their performances; how much swing they use; how much they deviate from the metronome (&ldquo;humanize&rdquo;); how far in front of or behind the beat they play (&ldquo;feel&rdquo;); the frequency and complexity of their fills; the bassist and keyboardist&rsquo;s melodic range; what kinds of arpeggiation the &ldquo;arpeggiated&rdquo; keyboardist performs; the kind of voicings the keyboardist plays with each hand; how many grace notes the keyboardist plays; how many ghost notes the drummer plays; how many notes, slides, blue notes, and dead notes the bassist plays; the kind of grooves the bassist plays; and more beyond that. I always customize all of these; in particular, I usually crank &ldquo;complexity&rdquo;, &ldquo;fill amount&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fill complexity&rdquo; all the way up.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The first half of this song features a steadily building arrangement that I wrote for the OST, but the structure heard here will not necessarily match what players hear in the game exactly. As players complete mission objectives in the level this track will appear in, the game will add melodic layers to the existing arrangement. Thus, the music will get louder and more complex as players progress through the level.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">That said, I was impressed enough with Logic&rsquo;s session musicians that I decided to feature them without my added accompaniments for the second half of the song &ndash; it feels like a modern structural equivalent of extended 12&rdquo; disco mixes that used to feature lengthy instrumental breakdowns towards the end.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The song title is a take-off on a movement of <span class="accent weight3">Genesis</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/9hKYpNpajpI" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink">Supper&rsquo;s Ready</a>&rdquo;</span>, namely <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8 (co-starring the delicious talents of Gabble Ratchet)&rdquo;</span>. I began using this title semi-ironically, but the more I con&shy;sid&shy;ered it, the more it felt appropriate. For starters, its chord progression strongly resembles one I used in a song I performed on my album <em><a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/music/demos2014.html" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">Demos 2014</a></em><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;aaronfreed<span class="breaker">.</span>github<span class="breaker">.</span>io<span class="breaker">/</span>music<span class="breaker">/</span>demos2014<span class="breaker">.</span>html&#10217;</span>, called simply <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span>, that I habitually used to perform after I covered an excerpt of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span> that doesn&rsquo;t strictly belong to either <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> or to its preceding movement, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Willow Farm&rdquo;</span>; in fact, it appears on <em class="toc-counter weight2">Demos 2014</em> in that exact form. So, effectively, if <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span> used to take the place of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> when I covered a segment of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span>, then it feels appropriate to name a track with a similar chord progression after <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">So, in part, this track&rsquo;s title is a tribute to one of my favourite bands. And of course, any self-respecting disco fan is aware of tracks like <span class="weight3 accent">the Trammps</span>&rsquo; <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Disco Inferno&rdquo;</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">David Shire</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Night on Disco Mountain&rdquo;</span> (which in turn is a disco version of <span class="weight3 accent dotted" title="Russian: Модестъ Петровичъ Мусоргскій; romanized: Modest&rsquo; Petrovich&rsquo;s Musorgskiy. (Note that in modern Russian, his name would be written as Модест Петрович Мусоргский, or Modest Petrovich Musorgskyy)">Modest Mussorgsky</span>&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent dotted" title="Russian: Ночь на лысой горе; romanized: Noch&rsquo; na lysoy gore">Night on Bald Mountain</em>).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The other major inspiration on this feels too obvious to note, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway: <span class="accent weight3">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: &#x300C;プレ&#x30EA;ュード&#x300D;, &ldquo;Purery&umacr;do&rdquo; (note: this link is to Mathew Valente&rsquo;s excellent restoration of the Final Fantasy VI arrangement)">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/albC3EHqeL4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink">Prelude</a>&rdquo;</span> from the <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> series. I&rsquo;m noting it because, until I began watching <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: スタジオジ&#x30D6;&#x30EA; (Sutajio Jiburi)">Studio Ghibli</span>&rsquo;s filmography from start to finish in 2024, I didn&rsquo;t realize how large an influence <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: 久石 譲, Hisaishi J&omacr;; stage name of &#34276;澤 守 (Fujisawa Mamoru)">Joe Hisaishi</span> had so many Japanese composers. I&rsquo;d liken the experience to that of a person who&rsquo;d only listened to Western pop music from the last 50 years for their entire life finally hearing <span class="accent weight3">the Beatles</span>. None of the composers I&rsquo;d listened to bothered mentioning Hisaishi as an influence because &ndash; well, wasn&rsquo;t it obvious? As it turned out, not to people who hadn&rsquo;t heard him. So, while the influence of <span class="toc-counter weight2">Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Prelude&rdquo;</span> is no doubt obvious to those familiar with the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Final Fantasy</em> series&rsquo; music, I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;La fine di innocenza&rdquo;</span>.</p>

			<li>Very few songs that use Loc&shy;ri&shy;an <em>stay</em> in Loc&shy;ri&shy;an for their en&shy;ti&shy;re run&shy;ning time; this is like&shy;ly no ex&shy;cep&shy;tion.</li>

			<li>As a re&shy;sult of this, Loc&shy;rian is great for es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing not just an un&shy;sett&shy;ling at&shy;mos&shy;phere, but a sense that we&rsquo;re ne&shy;ver tru&shy;ly at &ldquo;home&rdquo;, or at least don&rsquo;t stay there for long.</li>

		<p class="fixheight">That&rsquo;s not ev&shy;en get&shy;ting in&shy;to the time sig&shy;na&shy;ture she&shy;na&shy;ni&shy;gans: the first mea&shy;sure is 1/8, the sec&shy;ond is 2/8, the third is 3/8, the fourth is 4/8, and so on, down to mea&shy;sure 21, which is 21/8. Then the cy&shy;cle re&shy;peats. So if you thought this track was in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly rhyth&shy;mic&shy;al&shy;ly dis&shy;o&shy;ri&shy;en&shy;ting&hellip; you&rsquo;re right. It is.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For all of that, this track&rsquo;s sec&shy;ond move&shy;ment is sur&shy;pri&shy;sing&shy;ly chill. Loc&shy;ri&shy;an mode is full of pa&shy;ra&shy;dox&shy;es.

The guitar in the right channel quotes <a href="https://youtu.be/Nnuq9PXbywA?t=150" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">the opening of the fugue</a> from <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span>&rsquo;s famous <span class="accent weight3"><em class="weight4">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</em>, BWV 565</span>. This is actually the second time I&rsquo;ve quoted both these compositions in the same track; my <a href="https://youtu.be/bRiDh3PziWU?t=495" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">arrangement</a> of <span class="accent weight3">Alex Seropian</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>, 1994) does the same thing. I&rsquo;d like to claim that I did this on purpose, but it didn&rsquo;t occur to me until after I&rsquo;d already done it. The Bach quote, incidentally, is one of the few times I broke from strictly adhering to the scale of B Locrian &ndash; it sounded wrong without the accidentals.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&tau;&#8112;&rho;&#8112;&chi;&#974;&delta;&eta;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">tarakh&#7763;d&emacr;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">chaotic</em> in ancient Greek, while <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&#972;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">gal&emacr;n&oacute;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">peaceful</em>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Additional note for you math nerds out there: the pitch ratio of a perfect fifth is approximately 3:2, and the pitch ratio of a perfect fourth (the interval needed to complete the octave above a perfect fifth) is <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref04" title="More precisely, in twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET, the basis of modern Western instrument tuning, which uses 2^(1/12) [&asymp;1.05946309436] pitch ratios between notes), a perfect fifth&rsquo;s ratio is 2^(7/12):1 (&asymp;1.49830707688:1; cf. &sup3;&frasl;&#8322; = 1.5:1), while a perfect fourth&rsquo;s is 2^(5/12):1 (&asymp;1.33483985417; cf. 4/3 = 1.333333&hellip;:1). 12-TET very likely became standard because it&rsquo;s the smallest equal temperament that so closely approximates 3:2 and 4:3, which have been considered fundamental ratios of musical harmony at least since Pythagoras&rsquo; day.">approximately 4:3.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt04" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8308;&#8318;</a></span> The tritone, meanwhile, has a ratio of exactly &radic;<span class="radical-number">2</span>:1.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Finally, a few notes on <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span> (undoubtedly still my biggest musical influence): this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toccata_and_Fugue_in_D_minor,_BWV_565#Reception" target="_blank" class="noprintlink underline songlink weight3">Wikipedia paragraph</a> on <em class="toc-counter weight2">Toc&shy;cata and Fugue in D minor</em>&rsquo;s reception might as well open <span class="accent weight3">Charles Dic&shy;kens</span>&rsquo; <em class="accent weight3">A Tale of Two Cities</em>:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight toc-counter">&ldquo;The composition has been deemed both &lsquo;particularly suited to the organ&rsquo; and &lsquo;strikingly unorganistic&rsquo;. It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, but also as containing &lsquo;passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea&rsquo;. It has been called &lsquo;entirely a thing of virtuosity&rsquo; yet also described as being &lsquo;not so difficult as it sounds&rsquo;. It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, but also as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm. It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style. Its period of origin has been assumed to have been as early as around 1704, and as late as the 1750s. Its defining characteristics have been associated with extant compositions by Bach (BWV 531, 549a, 578, 911, 914, 922 and several of the solo violin sonatas and partitas), and by others (including Nicolaus Bruhns and Johann Heinrich Buttstett), as well as with untraceable earlier versions for other instruments and/or by other composers. It has been deemed too simplistic for it to have been written down by Bach, and too much a stroke of genius to have been composed by anyone else but Bach.&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight"><del>In short, it was a composition very much like present-d</del> I&rsquo;m sorry; I can&rsquo;t even type that with a straight face.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, I&rsquo;ve performed the toccata in its entirety on both piano and pipe organ and didn&rsquo;t find it especially difficult (this was 25 years ago, so I don&rsquo;t have a recording; sorry). I also find it far too ingenious to <em>not</em> be by Bach, but then, I was taught <span class="accent weight3">Christian Petzold</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" id="ftnt_ref05" title="Performance by Lang Lang (Chinese: &#37070;&#26391;; pinyin: L&aacute;ng L&#462;ng); also includes Petzold&rsquo;s less famous Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115, which is part of a pair with BWV Anh. 114, and which I think I actually like more. Lang also comments on why both minuets are works of genius, and why they&rsquo;re such fantastic pieces for beginners to learn.  &para;  BWV Anh. stands for &ldquo;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis Anhang&rdquo;, German for &ldquo;Bach-Works-Catalogue Annex&rdquo;, &ldquo;a list of lost, doubtful, or spurious compositions by, or once attributed to, Johann Sebastian Bach&rdquo; (Wikipedia)."><span class="accent weight3"><a href="https://youtu.be/hw19cy5bV6E" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">Minuet in G</a>,</span> <span lang="de-de">BWV Anh. 114</span>,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt05" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8309;&#8318;</a></span> as a Bach piece and was shocked to learn the attribution to Bach was spurious (and was known to be when I was taught it &ndash; pedagogy took a long time to catch up with scholarship).

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use the chaotic version of this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> levels <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Repository Four&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Polygonum opus&rdquo;</span>, before you complete the mission; the latter will switch to the calm variant, which I also intend to use on other repository levels (except <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The End&rdquo;</span>).</p>

		<p class="fixheight toc-counter centred">composer: <span class="accent weight3">Aaron Freed</span>, 2024-07-24 to 2024-08-24</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I stole this song&rsquo;s rhythm from <span class="accent weight3">the Allman Brothers Band</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span> (studio: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/nfrSIUE3iAE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">The Allman Brothers Band</a></em>, 1969; definitive live recording: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/4ppYldfTMiE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">At Fillmore East</a></em>, 1971), likely the most famous use of 11/8 in rock history (despite its composer <span class="toc-counter weight2">Gregg Allman</span> <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref06" title="Per the man himself: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t feel one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes. &hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rdquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rdquo; Duane just said, &ldquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rdquo;&rsquo;  &para;  (Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly wrong, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)">apparently not understanding this<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt06" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8310;&#8318;</a></span>), so if it feels slightly off-kilter rhythmically, that&rsquo;s entirely intentional. A few of its chords may be similar to those of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span>, too. Another big influence is undoubtedly <span class="accent weight3">Led Zeppelin</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight2">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/w772GXG5LnE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink">Dazed and Confused</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Led Zeppelin</em>, 1969).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">However, it sounds quite different from either &ndash; despite the fairly metal-influenced (synthesized) guitar solo towards the end, it has a major jazz fusion/progressive electronic vibe, despite paradoxically having virtually no blue notes and sticking fairly strictly to the <span class="toc-counter weight2">D Dorian</span> scale. It&rsquo;s also quite a bit more unpredictable and even chaotic than what I set out to make. A friend described it as sounding like <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> boss fight music, which feels entirely accurate. My mother also compared it to <span class="accent weight3">Tears for Fears</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Sowing the Seeds of Love&rdquo;</span> (<span class="noprint">album mix: </span><em><a href="https://youtu.be/XEQKy8g5UK4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">The Seeds of Love</a></em>, 1989<span class="noprint">; the <a href="https://youtu.be/VAtGOESO7W8" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">music video</a> is a minute shorter</span>), which also feels accurate (<em class="toc-counter weight2">The Seeds of Love</em>, a lost classic of the late &rsquo;80s, has been one of my favorite albums for 35 years).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The title (Italian for &ldquo;Portrait in Gray&rdquo;) is a pun on the Dorian mode by way of <span class="accent weight3">Oscar Wilde</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> &ndash; a sort of song title equivalent of Cockney rhyming slang.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I feel almost certain that I&rsquo;ll write at least one more movement of this track (perhaps preceding the first one, perhaps following the last), and I have absolutely no idea where it&rsquo;s going. I&rsquo;ve had it suggested to me to use an ABB&rsquo;A&rsquo; structure for this track, which I&rsquo;m currently contemplating; if I do so, it&rsquo;ll be entirely safe to wager money on me throwing in at least one brief reference to <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Mamma Mia!&rdquo;</span> or some other <span class="accent weight3">ABBA</span> banger. (<span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Mamma Mia!&rdquo;</span> is the likeliest due to its Italian title.)</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">The acoustic movement is currently a very early work in progress and does not qualify as the B&rsquo;A&rsquo; section &ndash; it&rsquo;s an early attempt at the &ldquo;mission complete&rdquo; music.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Theatre of Pain&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Another work in progress. I wrote most of it while Hurricane Debby was passing overhead. Logic Pro&rsquo;s Latin percussionist, which I used on this track, has a preset called &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo;; the title was predestined, though as with many others, I translated it to Italian for the first movement, which also gives us a nice pun. (For the second, I translated it to Spanish, owing to the whole piece&rsquo;s substantial Latin jazz influence.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Overall, this is an experiment in tonality. Several tracks above deviate from the diatonic scale&rsquo;s modes rarely, if ever; here, in an effort to seesaw between harmony and exceeding Loc&shy;ri&shy;an&rsquo;s dissonance, I took a more chromatic approach. It&rsquo;s too early to know if I&rsquo;ve succeeded, but the results seem promising.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I tentatively plan to use this track on the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> level <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Towel Boy&rdquo;</span>; as players progress through the level, we&rsquo;ll add new instruments, then once the Juggernaut dies, we&rsquo;ll switch to the jazz version.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I may be the only person that actually hears this, but this song is vaguely inspired by <span class="accent weight3">System of a Down</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/CSvFpBOe8eY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">Chop Suey!</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Toxicity</em>, 2001). The biggest tells are that, like its inspiration, it&rsquo;s in G minor and makes heavy use of start-stop dynamics. (It&rsquo;s also titled after a recurring line from &ldquo;Chop Suey!&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s one of the few <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> track titles I haven&rsquo;t translated into a foreign language because neither Italian nor Latin have split infinitives.) It turned into something quite different, though.</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">The other vague inspiration I can name is <span class="accent weight3">Radiohead</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Q29iibXXiOs" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">In Limbo</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Kid A</em>, 2000), another song that lives rent-free in my head (actually, most of that album does). Whenever I hear a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Fender Rhodes</span> play a fuguelike melody, that song immediately comes to mind.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I didn&rsquo;t even try to make this song&rsquo;s jazz version resemble its metal version, besides their chords &ndash; in fact, they have no instrument parts in common. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem: the transitions within the metal movement are meant to be jarring, so why shouldn&rsquo;t the transition to jazz <em>also</em> come out of nowhere?</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This is likely to remain the shortest track I write for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em>; stretching it out too long would spoil the effect. I&rsquo;ll likely use it for a short secret level like <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Beyond the Black&rdquo;</span>.</p>

I also men&shy;tioned that I wan&shy;ted to at&shy;tempt a few further mash-ups; he seemed to find that idea mo&shy;der&shy;ate&shy;ly in&shy;ter&shy;es&shy;ting, but he di&shy;rect&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me to try to write some&shy;thing en&shy;tire&shy;ly new based on the OST stems. (Just the fact that he re&shy;leased the OST stems at all is awe&shy;some, I have to add.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;d con&shy;si&shy;dered that idea se&shy;ve&shy;ral times be&shy;fore then, and ev&shy;e&shy;ry time I&rsquo;d done so, I&rsquo;d felt too in&shy;ti&shy;mi&shy;da&shy;ted to try. But since Chris had per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me, I put that a&shy;side and load&shy;ed four stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/eQyP7qocptY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3 noprintlink">The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky</a>&rdquo;</span> in&shy;to Logic: the lead me&shy;lo&shy;dy, the drum and per&shy;cus&shy;sion tracks, and the bass guitar. I then at&shy;temp&shy;ted to write my own chords and ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ni&shy;ment and was shocked at:</p>

				<ol class="loweralpha normal fixheight">
					<li style="margin-bottom: 2px;">how na&shy;tu&shy;ral&shy;ly I came up with sub&shy;stan&shy;tial&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent chords for most of the me&shy;lo&shy;dy</li>
					<li style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;">how com&shy;plete&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent its mood felt</li>
					<li style="margin-top: 2px;">how in&shy;com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sib&shy;ly sub&shy;lime the result felt</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="fixheight">To be fair, part of this is be&shy;cause Chris&rsquo; work is on another level. (I al&shy;rea&shy;dy men&shy;tioned in an end&shy;note for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Not Ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly FFIV&rdquo;</span> that <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is now tied with <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="kanji: &#26893;&#26494; &#20280;&#22827;; hiragana: &#12358;&#12360;&#12414;&#12388; &#12398;&#12406;&#12362;; r&omacr;maji: Uematsu Nobuo">No&shy;bu&shy;o U&shy;e&shy;mat&shy;su</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Japanese: &#x5996;&#x661F;&#x4E71;&#x821E; (Y&omacr;sei Ranbu), literally &ldquo;Wild Dance of the Ominous Star&rdquo;">&ldquo;Dan&shy;cing Mad&rdquo;</span> as my fa&shy;vor&shy;ite piece ever writ&shy;ten for a vi&shy;de&shy;o game.)</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I did find my&shy;self stumped when I got to what, for lack of a bet&shy;ter word, I&rsquo;ll call the break&shy;down about four min&shy;utes into the piece. I&rsquo;ve ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly co&shy;pied the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;al chords, be&shy;cause ev&shy;en af&shy;ter trans&shy;crib&shy;ing the me&shy;lo&shy;dy and har&shy;mo&shy;ny for that seg&shy;ment by ear, the the&shy;o&shy;ry be&shy;hind it con&shy;founds me. Every chord I&rsquo;ve tried there be&shy;sides the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;als has felt com&shy;plete&shy;ly off. I don&rsquo;t un&shy;der&shy;stand how or why it works, but the re&shy;so&shy;lu&shy;tion it provides, both in Chris&rsquo; original and in my va&shy;ri&shy;a&shy;tion, is off the charts &ndash; which is es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly re&shy;mar&shy;kab&shy;le be&shy;cause, un&shy;til it hits, nei&shy;ther piece even feels like it&rsquo;s been buil&shy;ding ten&shy;sion.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve also tweaked the notes of the original song&rsquo;s bass line. I&rsquo;m actually quite proud of this &ndash; in particular, I managed to change the interval between a pair of connected notes at around 4:24 in a way that sounded natural. This actually took some rather precise sound editing: I wound up cross-fading quickly between a version pitch-shifted up three half-steps and one pitch-shifted up four half-steps.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This move&shy;ment&rsquo;s ti&shy;tle (if I haven&rsquo;t made any mis&shy;takes, which is quite pos&shy;si&shy;ble) is An&shy;cient Greek (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Ho z&iacute;n&shy;gos a&uacute;x&shy;e&shy;tai m&eacute;&shy;gas&rdquo;</em>) for <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;The Whir&shy;ring Grows Loud&rdquo;</span>, the phrase <em class="weight3 accent">Risk of Rain 2</em> dis&shy;plays just be&shy;fore the op&shy;tion&shy;al boss <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Al&shy;loy Wor&shy;ship Un&shy;it</span> spawns (which, in the un&shy;mod&shy;ded game, can on&shy;ly oc&shy;cur on <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Si&shy;ren&rsquo;s Call</span>, one of two sta&shy;ges that uses <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span>). I trans&shy;la&shy;ted it to Greek part&shy;ly be&shy;cause <em>Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em> is it&shy;self Greek (<em>μά&shy;ρα&shy;θον</em> means <em>fen&shy;nel</em> in ancient Greek; the to&shy;po&shy;nym re&shy;fers to the plant&rsquo;s pre&shy;val&shy;ence in the ar&shy;e&shy;a), part&shy;ly as a tri&shy;bute to <span class="accent weight3">Van&shy;gel&shy;is</span> (a mas&shy;sive in&shy;flu&shy;ence on both Chris and me &ndash; why else do you think we both use so much <span class="accent weight3">CS-80</span>?), and part&shy;ly as a tri&shy;bute to Chris him&shy;self.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This tran&shy;si&shy;tion is jar&shy;ring, and I&rsquo;m not ev&shy;en sure I want to fix it. In fact, I&rsquo;m fair&shy;ly sure I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a ma&shy;jor e&shy;mo&shy;tion&shy;al shift be&shy;tween these two move&shy;ments, and I think it&rsquo;s even more ef&shy;fec&shy;tive if it&rsquo;s sud&shy;den.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve experimented before with <span class="weight3 accent">Frank Zappa</span>&rsquo;s concept of <span class="accent weight3">xenochrony</span> (from <em class="toc-counter weight2">ξένος</em> [<em class="toc-counter weight2">x&eacute;nos</em>; <em class="toc-counter weight2">strange, alien</em>] and <em class="toc-counter weight2">χρόνος</em> [<em class="toc-counter weight2">khr&oacute;nos</em>; <em class="toc-counter weight2">time</em>]; thus, <em>strange time</em>), wherein a musical part is extracted outside its original context in one song and placed in another (which <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Zappa</span> claimed was the only way to achieve certain rhythmic effects). Good examples include <em class="accent weight3">Eternal</em>&rsquo;s extended <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Flippant&rdquo;</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> remixes and the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>/<em class="toc-counter weight2">Risk of Rain 2</em> mash-up I mentioned in my commentary for movement &alpha; of this very track. But I think this is the furthest I&rsquo;ve taken the concept to date.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">From the very start, I&rsquo;d intended this move&shy;ment to mash up mul&shy;ti&shy;ple <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em> songs. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to fur&shy;ther <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> stems (i.e., the vocals), I worked in some stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/VTJcLE_VVX8" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">They Might as Well Be Dead</a>&rdquo;</span> that, after I pitch-shif&shy;ted them from D mi&shy;nor to C mi&shy;nor and slowed them from 100 to 88 bpm, dove&shy;tailed beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly with the for&shy;mer song&rsquo;s syn&shy;the&shy;si&shy;zer so&shy;lo, <span id="ftnt_ref07" class="dotted" title="Translator&rsquo;s note: &lsquo;keikaku&rsquo; means &lsquo;plan&rsquo;.  &para;  (In case you were curious, &ldquo;keikaku-d&omacr;ri&rdquo;, the source of the memetic &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo;, is written in kanji as &#x300C;計画 通り&#x300D; or &#x300C;計劃 通り&#x300D; and in hiragana as &#x300C;けいかく どおり&#x300D;.)">just according to <em>keikaku</em><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt07" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8311;&#8318;</a>.</span> (<span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly 110 bpm, but it&rsquo;s also 5/4, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is 4/4; thus, lin&shy;ing the meas&shy;ures up re&shy;qui&shy;res mak&shy;ing the lat&shy;ter&rsquo;s tem&shy;po 80% of the for&shy;mer&rsquo;s.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">But while I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted the two songs to fit to&shy;geth&shy;er, I was ab&shy;so&shy;lute&shy;ly flab&shy;ber&shy;gas&shy;ted at <em>how well</em> they fit. I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted to have to fi&shy;nag&shy;le the har&shy;mo&shy;ny of the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> segments at least a lit&shy;tle bit, but my in&shy;stincts had been dead-on: ev&shy;e&shy;ry&shy;thing fit per&shy;fect&shy;ly as soon as I lined it up. It&rsquo;s not that the chord pro&shy;gres&shy;sions are i&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;cal &ndash; far from it, in fact. The me&shy;lo&shy;dy of Chris&rsquo; solo in the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> simp&shy;ly hap&shy;pens to work per&shy;fect&shy;ly over the chords from the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">Since that worked so well, I also added stems from <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/LEUwTBWkeas" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">Mois&shy;ture De&shy;fi&shy;cit</a>&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/81QhAo3hLrM" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink noprintlink">Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by</a>&rdquo;</span>. <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Moisture Deficit&rdquo;</span> was ob&shy;vi&shy;ous: <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is a re&shy;make of it. Most of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by&rdquo;</span>&rsquo;s stems al&shy;so fit flawlessly, but <span class="accent weight3">Kal&shy;li&shy;o&shy;pi Mit&shy;ro&shy;pou&shy;lou</span>&rsquo;s harmonies are slightly out of phase with the other songs&rsquo; chord progressions during the climax &ndash; which I like, since the sensation of something being out of place feels appropriate for a game wherein alien slavers attack Renaissance Italy.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This movement contains some complex polyrhythms: <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Raindrop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is in 5/8, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is in 4/4. <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Moisture Deficit&rdquo;</span> switches between 7/4, 4/4, and 5/4, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Once in a Lullaby&rdquo;</span> uses 4/2 and 7/4, according to the PDF included with the stems. This gives us 5:4, 7:4, and 7:5 polyrhythms in places, though 5:4 is the most prominent by far. Most of this song predominantly feels like 5/8, but once the drums from <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> dominate the mix (starting at 9:51), it predominantly feels like 4/4 &ndash; in short, a classic example of time signature modulation (although, for my own convenience, I notated everything as 5/8 within Logic).</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This ti&shy;tle (again, if I haven&rsquo;t made any er&shy;rors) is Ancient Greek (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;On&shy;ei&shy;ro&shy;po&shy;le&shy;&iacute;s t&#7703;n bi&shy;a&iacute;&shy;&amacr;n aux&shy;&iacute;&shy;sin&rdquo;</em>) for <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;You Dream of Vi&shy;ol&shy;ent Growth&rdquo;</span>, <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain 2</em>&rsquo;s description of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Sun&shy;dered Grove</span> (the stage that plays <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>) when it is selected as the next stage at the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Lu&shy;nar Seer</span>.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;m not totally sure I&rsquo;ve gotten the grammar right &ndash; in fact, I&rsquo;ve already changed it twice. I first incorrectly used the uncontracted form of the verb (<em>-έεις</em> instead of <em>-εῖς</em>); then I used &laquo;Ὀνειροπολεῖς τῆς βῐαίᾱς αὐξήσεος&raquo; (<em>Oneiropole&iacute;s t&ecirc;s bia&iacute;&amacr;s a&uacute;x&emacr;seos</em>), which uses the Koine genitive case of the noun phrase <em>ἡ βῐαίᾱ αὔξησις</em> (<em>h&emacr; bia&iacute;&amacr; a&uacute;xesis</em>, <em>the violent growth</em>), since genitive is the equivalent of an English possessive (i.e., <em>of violent growth</em>. I specifically used Koine declensions because New Testament Greek&rsquo;s dialect felt thematically appropriate for the level with the most memorable cathedral ever constructed in the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> engine.) However, I later realized that, since <em>ὀνειροπολέω</em> (<em>oneiropol&eacute;o</em>) means <em>I dream of</em>, the genitive case probably isn&rsquo;t necessary or even correct here; thus, I changed the noun phrase to the accusative case (the equivalent of an English direct object). I&rsquo;m still not sure this is correct; finding credible English-language sources on ancient Greek grammar is quite difficult.</p>

			<p class="fixheight">A fast-paced track in 13/8 &ndash; a mixture of (5+5+3)/8 and (4+4+5)/8, if you prefer subdivisions of time signatures this complex &ndash; that mostly sticks to diminished chords. It wound up a couple minutes longer than I planned it to be, mostly because it turned out far catchier than it has any right to be &ndash; every time I listened to the shorter version, I found myself wanting more of it, so I wrote more. I may or may not make a &ldquo;subdued&rdquo; version of this &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t fully narrowed down what level I&rsquo;ll use it on, but the two likeliest candidates won&rsquo;t really have much exploration left once the player clears the most intense segment of the level.</p>
			
			<p class="fixheight">The title, Latin for &ldquo;a storm of wrath&rdquo;, is naturally a pun on <em>Tempus Irae</em> (&ldquo;time of wrath&rdquo;) &ndash; related is the fact that in most Romance languages, the word for <em>time</em> can also mean <em>weather</em>. This is true in Spanish (<em>tiempo</em>), Italian (<em>tempo</em>), Portuguese (also <em>tempo</em>), French (<em>temps</em>), Romanian (<em>timp</em>)&hellip;</p>

			<p class="fixheight">Perhaps coincidentally, this track has something in common with this collection&rsquo;s other storm-related track (besides a heavy use of diminished chords): I wrote most of it after being awakened by a nasty storm early that morning. At the time, I lived in the stormiest part of the country, so it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> coincidental, but I&rsquo;d thought of the title a few weeks prior, and only after applying it did I notice the connection.</p>

(I&rsquo;ve joked before that if you look up &ldquo;nocturnal music&rdquo; in the dictionary, it will play you a sample of <span class="toc-counter weight2">Massive Attack</span>&rsquo;s music to define the term.) &ldquo;T&umacr;t&emacr;la&rdquo; is Latin for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Protection&rdquo;</span>, the name of the track that most heavily inspired this &ndash; the largest tells are probably that it&rsquo;s written in a mix of B major and B minor and uses descending chord progressions throughout its entire runtime. (<em>Tūtēlā</em> can also mean <em>tutelage</em>, as one might expect; meanwhile, &ldquo;Apologiīs Impetuī Immēnsō&rdquo;, found in the tag comments, is Latin for &ldquo;With apologies to Massive Attack&rdquo;.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Ultimately, my arrangement isn&rsquo;t nearly as sparse as <span class="toc-counter weight2">Massive Attack</span>&rsquo;s; this chord progression is very jazzy, so I played that up heavily. I also threw an even heavier emphasis on the dance elements that already dominate <span class="toc-counter weight2">Massive Attack</span>&rsquo;s song. However &ndash; and if you&rsquo;ve listened to enough of the previous tracks or even read my commentary for them, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve already predicted this &ndash; I also wrote the entire song in 5/4.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">&ldquo;T&umacr;t&emacr;la&rdquo;, unsurprisingly, is the &ldquo;mission finished&rdquo; version of this track. For most of these tracks, I wrote the more intense &rdquo;mission unfinished&rdquo; version first and then made the &ldquo;mission finished&rdquo; version by making a stripped-down or acoustic arrangement thereof; in this case, the contemplative mood felt appropriate for the &ldquo;mission complete&rdquo; track. I hadn&rsquo;t been planning for each loop to last for 7:12, but that&rsquo;s about the length of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Protection&rdquo;</span> (the album version, at least), so that seems appropriate somehow.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I naturally called the metal version &ldquo;Impetus&rdquo;, which, beyond its English meaning, also means <em>attack</em> (noun, not verb) in Latin. Interestingly, despite having almost entirely different instrumentation and a very different atmosphere, I feel like it kept roughly the same mood as &ldquo;T&umacr;t&emacr;la&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m low-key proud of that.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">An&shy;oth&shy;er in&shy;flu&shy;ence also crept in: <span class="accent weight3">the Beat&shy;les</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/t1Jm5epJr10" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink" rel="nofollow">I Am the Wal&shy;rus</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Ma&shy;gi&shy;cal Mys&shy;te&shy;ry To&shy;ur</em>, 1967-11-24). <span class="accent weight3">George Mar&shy;tin</span>&rsquo;s string ar&shy;range&shy;ment in&shy;flu&shy;enced both my chord pro&shy;gres&shy;sion (a sub&shy;con&shy;scious in&shy;flu&shy;ence) and my own string ar&shy;range&shy;ment (a similarity I con&shy;scious&shy;ly played up af&shy;ter no&shy;ti&shy;cing it). Then ag&shy;ain, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Mas&shy;sive At&shy;tack</span> ex&shy;pli&shy;cit&shy;ly ac&shy;know&shy;ledge <span class="toc-counter weight2">the Beat&shy;les</span> as a for&shy;ma&shy;tive in&shy;flu&shy;ence (<em>e.g.</em>, the string ar&shy;range&shy;ment in <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/ZWmrfgj0MZI" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink" rel="nofollow">Un&shy;fin&shy;ished Sym&shy;pa&shy;thy</a>&rdquo;</span>&rsquo;s back half couldn&rsquo;t be more <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;I Am the Wal&shy;rus&rdquo;</span> if it tried), so this is un&shy;doub&shy;ted&shy;ly a case where a ma&shy;jor in&shy;flu&shy;ence on a con&shy;scious in&shy;flu&shy;ence, in turn, sub&shy;con&shy;scious&shy;ly in&shy;flu&shy;enced me.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">As a final note, writing this piece really drove home for me how context-dependent our perception of dissonance or consonance is &ndash; several of these chords would sound <em>awful</em> in isolation but work fine in the context of the harmonic progression. My favorite example is <span class="accent weight3">G&#9839;m7(maj7)</span>, which I actually had to enter manually into Logic (Apple apparently can&rsquo;t comprehend someone wanting to use both a minor 7th and a major 7th in the same chord). It sounded <em>wrong</em> when I listened to it in isolation, and I had to listen repeatedly to the entire progression in succession to feel satisfied that I really wanted <em>that</em> chord between <span class="accent weight3">D&#9839;m7(11)/A</span> and <span class="accent weight3">Bmaj7</span>. (Trying to replace it with other chords confirmed this &ndash; nothing else had the emotional impact I intended.) The entire progression, numbered starting from 0, is printed below. A few notes:</p>

				<ul class="initialsize fixheight">
					<li style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">An X means a note appears in at least one octave of the chord.</li>
					<li style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">This is an oversimplification of the harmony within each chord &ndash; two notes that are shown a second apart here may be a seventh or ninth apart in the chord itself.

					<li style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">As a result, playing these notes as written will not always sound good &ndash; some of the chords only work because of sevenths or ninths spaced above major or minor chords.

				<p class="fixheight">This is thus both one of my harmonically simpler tracks (it contains just one repeating chord progression) and one of my more harmonically complex tracks (it&rsquo;s a sixteen-chord progression with several convoluted chords that deviate heavily from the key signature &ndash; which is B minor, by the way, though it was an effectively arbitrary choice, since my scales rarely conform cleanly to either B minor <em>or</em> B major).</p>

				<p>A very early work in progress that I&rsquo;m not even sure will actually fit into <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> &ndash; if it doesn&rsquo;t, then I&rsquo;ll probably either use it for my unfinished scenario <em class="accent weight3">Marathon Chronicles</em> or just leave it as an exclusive for this collection. I&rsquo;ve been subconsciously ripping off <span class="toc-counter weight2">Yasunori Mitsuda</span> for so long that I felt he was long past due an outright tribute. This is named after a horrifically underrated track from <em class="accent weight3">Chrono Cross</em>. I have <span id="ftnt_ref08" class="dotted noprintlink" title="I like Chrono Cross overall, but among all works I&rsquo;ve ever experienced across all media, I suspect the only work whose ending has infuriated me more is La La Land (2016, dir. Damien Chazelle) &ndash; though to be fair to Chrono Cross, and to explain my complaints in as spoiler-free a manner as possible, La La Land&rsquo;s ending is flawed due to a writing misstep I still find incomprehensible (my stock comparison is to a mystery that ends immediately after introducing the killer, without providing a single hint as to their motives), while Chrono Cross&rsquo; is flawed because its devs literally ran out of time to finish it and had to relegate several planned plot twists to an end-of-game infodump. &para; I still contend that the ending is a major reason La La Land lost the Best Picture Oscar to Moonlight (2016, dir. Barry Jenkins). To this day, even though I greatly enjoyed the rest of La La Land, I&rsquo;ve been unable to sit through it again or even listen to its soundtrack &ndash; I found its ending&rsquo;s aftertaste that bitter. (continued)">mixed feelings about <em class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Cross</em> as a game, and especially as a sequel to <em class="accent weight3">Chrono Trigger</em><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt08" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8312;&#8318;</a></span>, but its OST is probably third only to <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy VI</em> and <em class="accent weight3">Risk of Rain 2</em> on my &ldquo;favourite game OSTs of all time&rdquo; list, and it&rsquo;s a defensible pick for the greatest of all time.</p>

				<p>Although the main melody is pretty much written by now, I haven&rsquo;t yet finished orchestrating this track, nor are all the instrument choices final; also, it just kind of ends abruptly. I plan to make the song feel more &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; overall by adding instruments like viole da gamba and lutes. I&rsquo;ll probably also try writing a completely different, more intense arrangement and see how it feels.</p>

				<p>The name is French for, well, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The Girl Who Stole the Stars&rdquo;</span> &ndash; again, I&rsquo;m not one to be coy about my influences. Why French, rather than Italian or Latin? In this case, I just preferred the sound of the words. The song tags contain the phrase <span class="toc-counter weight2">「光田さんに御免なさい」</span> (r&omacr;maji: <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Mitsuda-san ni gomen&rsquo;nasai&rdquo;</span>), meaning roughly <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;With apologies to Mitsuda-san&rdquo;</span>.</p>

				<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet determined which level, if any, I&rsquo;ll use this track on.</p>

				<p>One lesson <span class="accent weight3">Bungie</span> learned from the design process for <em class="accent weight3">Marathon</em> (1994-12-21) was not to make the opening levels before the rest of the game: you won&rsquo;t have even figured out the game&rsquo;s vibe yet, much less crucial aspects like its core gameplay loop. I suspect this applies equally well to soundtracks, so naturally, <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em>&rsquo;s first few levels were among the last I tried writing music for &ndash; I wanted a solid grasp on the style and overall vibe, and I knew that, no matter how solid my plans were, they would inevitably change. (I didn&rsquo;t know when I started out, for example, that roughly half the songs I wrote for it would be in 5/4.)</p>

				<p>Almost as soon as I began writing <span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;Ex temporis, ex loc&omacr;&rdquo;</span> (Latin for <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Out of Time, Out of Place&rdquo;</span>), I knew I wanted to use it for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em>&rsquo;s second level (and first Earth level), <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Gates of Delirium&rdquo;</span>. Its rather dreadful mood feels appropriate: alien slavers have followed you back in time to Renaissance Italy, leading to potentially disastrous results. It also feels quite mysterious, which is equally appropriate, since the reason you&rsquo;ve gone back in time is to recover a series of ten manuscripts by <span class="accent weight3">Leonardo da Vinci</span>.</p>

				<p>This may not be apparent to anyone else, but this track began life inspired by <span class="accent weight3">Radiohead</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Everything in Its Right Place&rdquo;</span>. Its first three chords are quite similar, and as <a href="https://youtu.be/upTDLfsuWZs" target="_blank" class="songlink underline weight3 noprintlink">Charles Cornell notes</a>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Everything in Its Right Place&rdquo;</span> uses a grand total of <em>four</em> chords across its entire four-minute running time (this is another case of a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Charles Cornell</span> video inspiring me to write a song). Ultimately, however, I wound up changing the chords (and the overall vibe) substantially</p>
				
				<p>Below is one possible way (among several) to notate this track&rsquo;s chord progression, numbered from 0-7. As with my similar table for &ldquo;T&umacr;t&emacr;la / Impetus&rdquo;, an X denotes a note that appears in at least one octave<span class="noprint">; the highlighted backgrounds correspond to a piano&rsquo;s white keys</span>. <span class="accent weight5">Bold, blue notes</span> correspond to a pattern involving the <span class="accent weight3">C Locrian</span> scale that I&rsquo;ll explain below.</p>

				<p>What&rsquo;s absolutely wild to me is that half these chords are technically major, yet it sounds amazingly dark. And what key signature is it in? I believe the correct answer to this question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. (If forced to pick, I&rsquo;d say <span class="toc-counter weight2">C Locrian</span>: although the opening and closing chords aren&rsquo;t diminished, the upper notes travel down the C Locrian scale, while, with one exception, its lower notes above the drone on C travel up it &ndash; this is the pattern I&rsquo;ve highlighted in blue in the above table.) I used to think I didn&rsquo;t understand jazz. I <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t think I understand jazz, but clearly, I somehow learned how to write it.</p>

				<p>At any rate, while this began life as a set of three borrowed chords from <span class="toc-counter weight2">Radiohead</span>, I quickly tweaked them and knew immediately that I was headed somewhere much different. (Though I probably don&rsquo;t even need to tell you by now that I wrote this song in 5/4 &ndash; <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Everything in Its Right Place&rdquo;</span> is in 10/4.) I open the track with primarily acoustic instrumentation before adding several synth arpeggiator layers, as one does. Closing the movement with the arpeggiation isolated is meant to emphasize that something is indeed out of place and time &ndash; namely, you (and the aliens that followed you).</p>

				<p>This track is probably complete, apart from tweaks to the mix. Overall, I wanted <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> to have a musical identity as distinct from <em class="accent weight3">Marathon</em>&rsquo;s as I was capable of crafting (while still sounding good), but I ultimately couldn&rsquo;t resist throwing in a single reference to <span class="accent weight3">Alex Seropian</span>&rsquo;s original <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> soundtrack. The bass flute that harmonizes with the oboe near the end quotes <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Flowers in Heaven&rdquo;</span>, which is probably as close as <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> has to a main theme (several other tracks, such as <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Swirls&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Splash (Marathon)&rdquo;</span>, use similar melodies). It feels appropriate for the sole musical reference to <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> to appear in what&rsquo;s highly likely to be the first original track in the game that most players will hear.</p>

				<p>It occurred to me after completing a satisfactory draft of <span class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">&ldquo;Ex temporis, ex loc&omacr;&rdquo;</span> that the chords and me&shy;lo&shy;dies I&rsquo;d written would, with little transmogrification necessary, make a fantastic atmospheric black metal track. It also occurred to me that bookending the original Earth campaign with variants of the same song would help make the soundtrack a lot more coherent and indeed satisfactory: it&rsquo;ll give players a sense of accomplishment, as though they&rsquo;ve come full circle. Enter <span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;N&omacr;n omnia in sua loc&omacr; corr&emacr;ct&omacr; erant&rdquo;</span> (Latin for <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Not everything was in its right place&rdquo;</span>), which will start to play once the player picks up the manuscript on <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Mt. Ve&shy;su&shy;vi&shy;us&rdquo;</span>. This track proved to be a massive pain to export, but I&rsquo;m satisfied with the results.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This may not be this collection&rsquo;s fi&shy;nal track when it&rsquo;s fin&shy;ished; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m done wri&shy;ting songs for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Tempus Irae Redux</em> yet, though I only plan to continue until approximately 2024-09-21 (an arbitrary date that I&rsquo;ve selected partly because it&rsquo;s the autumn equinox and partly due to that <span class="accent weight3">Earth, Wind & Fire</span> song &ndash; you know the one), or until there are two full CDs of material here, whichever comes first. Very likely, I&rsquo;ll write one or two more songs, go back and revise what I&rsquo;ve written for a couple of weeks, and then call it finished.</p>

	<h2 id="influences" class="centred">Artistic Influences</h2>

	<p class="fixheight">A complete list of my influences would double the length of this document, but I feel I must single out a few, either because I didn&rsquo;t directly mention them above, or because their influence on me was more profound than those mentions suggested. With the caveat that not being mentioned here doesn&rsquo;t preclude you from being a profound influence on me (my memory is notoriously spotty, and I&rsquo;m trying to keep this from being mere name-dropping), I wish to mention in particular:</p>

	<ul class="fixheight">
		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Johann Sebastian Bach</span>. <span class="accent weight3">Pat Metheny</span> perhaps put it best: &ldquo;Compared to <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span>, we all suck.&rdquo; All Western music of the past two centuries exists in his shadow, due either to his harmonic influence or to trying to escape his harmonic influence. He will very likely forever remain my profoundest musical influence.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Brian Eno</span>. No one has done more to aid my understanding of the process of creativity than <span class="toc-counter weight2">Eno</span> did with the <a href="https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html" target="_blank">Oblique Strategies</a>; only <span class="weight3 accent">Igor Stravinsky</span> even comes close (see <a href="#commentary">above</a>). That alone would earn him the second spot on this list, but his fantastic output as both self-proclaimed &ldquo;non-musician&rdquo; and producer has also been immensely influential to me. How many other living people can claim to have invented entire genres of music? One of the few living musicians I would, without question, label a genius.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Pink Floyd</span>. Hon&shy;est&shy;ly, they&rsquo;re pro&shy;bab&shy;ly why I be&shy;gan wri&shy;ting and per&shy;for&shy;ming music. <span class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Richard Wright</span>&rsquo;s soundscapes and <span class="accent weight3 petitecaps">David Gilmour</span>&rsquo;s lyrical guitar playing haunt my dreams, and what&shy;ever one might say about him now, <span class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Roger Waters</span>&rsquo; lyr&shy;ics pro&shy;bab&shy;ly did as much to for&shy;mu&shy;late my world&shy;view as any&shy;thing I read in school.</li>
		<li>
			<span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">The Beatles</span>. All Western popular music from the past 60 years owes something to their work, whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;trying to emulate <span class="toc-counter weight2">the Beatles</span>&rdquo; or it&rsquo;s &ldquo;trying desperately not to sound like <span class="toc-counter weight2">the Beatles</span>&rdquo;. Their impact was lightning in a bottle: most groups would kill for one composer as skilled as <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">John Lennon</strong>, <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Paul McCartney</strong>, or <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">George Harrison</strong>, and <span class="toc-counter weight2">the Beatles</span> had three; <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Ringo Starr</strong> was a drummer of immense technical skill, musicality, and restraint; <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">George Martin</strong> was perhaps the greatest producer in the history of pop music; and they came at the exact right time in the <em>zeitgeist</em> to revolutionize the world&rsquo;s consciousness.

			<p class="lowerpara">(Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve technically performed with <span class="toc-counter weight2">Ringo</span>; <span id="ftnt_ref09" class="dotted" title="Lightly adapted from my explanation on YouTube: &ldquo;They double-sold the tickets in our row, so they moved us to the front row. Ringo handed me the mic to sing the chorus of &ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo;. I was all of nine years old at the time. I&rsquo;m actually amazed I didn&rsquo;t freeze, and I&rsquo;m sure I must&rsquo;ve been off-key, but I did sing it. &para; At a different point in the show, Todd Rundgren also handed me the guitar pick to strum the final chord of one of his songs. As this was 31 years ago, I don&rdquo;t trust my memory of the song; my parents think it was &ldquo;We Gotta Get You a Woman&rdquo;, which sounds plausible. I still have that guitar pick somewhere. &para; &hellip; That was my first concert. Unfortunately, it was kind of like seeing a Studio Ghibli film or Cowboy Bebop as your first anime &ndash; almost everything else has been a letdown by comparison.&rdquo; (See footnote for longer explanation.)">as a child, I sang the chorus of <strong class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Yellow Submarine&rdquo;</strong> at an <strong class="accent weight3">All-Starr Band</strong> concert<a href="#ftnt09">&#8317;&#8313;&#8318;</a></span>, which probably gives me a closer musical association with <span class="toc-counter weight2">the Beatles</span> than anyone who has even a remote chance of reading this except <span class="accent weight3">Marty O&rsquo;Donnell</span>, who still undoubtedly has better things to read than my rambling.)</p>
		</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Nobuo Uematsu</span>. If the eleven-minute pastiche of his work didn&rsquo;t clue you in, I&rsquo;ll just add that I&rsquo;m not sure I can overstate how much I learned about writing for games simply by obsessively listening to his music. I listened to tons of game music when I was younger purely because I spent so long playing games, but <span class="toc-counter weight2">Ue&shy;mat&shy;su</span> convinced me game music was an artform worthy of consideration on its own merits, and had I not studied his soundtracks for so long, I&rsquo;d never have felt confident that I knew enough to start writing my own.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Marvin Gaye</span>. The sound of <em class="accent weight3">What&rsquo;s Going On</em>, especially its title track and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&rdquo;</span>, has lived rent-free in my head since I first heard them as a child; if any of these bass lines are even a tenth as smooth as the one <span class="accent weight3 petitecaps">James Jamerson</span> laid down for the title track, I&rsquo;ll be immensely pleased. <span class="accent weight3">Kurt Vonnegut</span>, a major literary and philosophical influence on me, wrote in <em class="accent weight3">Breakfast of Champions</em>, <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;All music is [sacred].&rdquo;</span> I still think of that quote often; whenever it does, only <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span> precedes <span class="toc-counter weight2">Gaye</span> as proof.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">John Coltrane</span>. The next example on my list after <span class="toc-counter weight2">Gaye</span>, although by rights, he should probably come first: I have yet to hear music more spiritually stirring than <em class="accent weight3">A Love Supreme</em>. In the history of jazz, perhaps only his mentor <span class="accent weight3">Miles Davis</span> (an equally large influence on me) outdid him for stylistic diversity, but even that&rsquo;s debatable: <em class="accent weight3">Giant Steps</em> set a new standard for technicality in jazz compositions, <em class="accent weight3">Ascension</em> redefined the entire concept of harmony in jazz, and countless metal acts would sell their souls for an album as heavy as <em class="accent weight3">The Olatunji Concert</em>. Even 500 years from now, we&rsquo;ll probably still be trying to catch up to <span class="toc-counter weight2">Trane</span>.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Magma</span>. I doubt anyone will hear their influence in my music, as their sound is so esoteric I&rsquo;ve only ever heard two other acts successfully mimic it: <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Kanji: 高円寺百景; hiragana: こえんじ ひゃっけい; literally &ldquo;One Hundred Sights of K&omacr;enji&rdquo;. K&omacr;enji is a district of T&omacr;ky&omacr; in the Suginami ward, west of Shinjuku.">Kōenji Hyakkei</span> and <span class="accent weight3">Chris Christodoulou</span> (<span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Tl&amacr;l&omacr;c&amacr;n&rdquo;</span>, a tribute to <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;De Futura&rdquo;</span> especially). <span class="toc-counter weight2">Magma</span> mastered the art of creating absolutely alien-sounding music that is nonetheless immensely catchy, likely assisted by their impeccable rhythmic sense (bandleader and main songwriter <span class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Christian Vander</span> is also their drummer &ndash; it&rsquo;s surely no coincidence that <span class="toc-counter weight2">Christodoulou</span> and <span class="toc-counter weight2">K&omacr;enji Hyakkei</span>&rsquo;s leader <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Kanji: 吉田 達也; hiragana: よしだ たつや; r&omacr;maji: Yoshida Tatsuya">Tatsuya Yoshida</span> are also both drummers). They are, in turn, among the few artists I&rsquo;ve heard to approach <span class="toc-counter weight2">Coltrane</span>&rsquo;s spirituality &ndash; little surprise, since he&rsquo;s their biggest influence.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps dotted" title="Kanji: 椎名 林檎; (hiragana: しいな りんご; r&omacr;maji: Shīna Ringo); real name 椎名 裕美子 (hiragana: しいな ゆみこ; r&omacr;maji: Shīna Yumiko). 「林檎」 is Japanese for &ldquo;apple&rdquo;; apparently, this derives partly from a childhood nickname she got from the color of her cheeks when she blushed, and partly from Ringo Starr. Her favourite mangaka&rsquo;s pen name, 吉田 戦車 (hiragana: よしだ せんしゃ; r&omacr;maji: Yoshida Sensha), inspired her use of &ldquo;Ringo&rdquo; as a stage name: &ldquo;Sensha&rdquo; means &ldquo;Tank&rdquo;.">Sh&imacr;na Ringo</span>. One of those completely bonkers, off-the-wall, indescribable musicians. The correct answer to &ldquo;What genre of music does Sh&imacr;na Ringo perform?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; <em class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Japanese: 加爾基 精液 栗ノ花; unofficial hiragana: かるき せいえき くりのはな (r&omacr;maji: Karuki Seieki Kuri no Hana); official katakana: カルキ ザーメン クリノハナ (r&omacr;maji: Karuki Z&amacr;men Kuri no Hana); literally &ldquo;Bleaching Powder, Semen, Chestnut Flower&rdquo;. Ringo renamed the album from &ldquo;Wonderful, Vulgar, Eccentric&rdquo; (Japanese: 不思議・猥雑・エキセントリック; r&omacr;maji: Fushigi, Waizatsu, Ekisentorikku) after overhearing two of her staff argue about whether semen smelled more like bleaching powder or chestnut flowers. &para; &ldquo;Kalk&rdquo; is the Dutch word for &ldquo;limestone&rdquo; or &ldquo;chlorine&rdquo; (a component of bleaching powder) and a cognate of &ldquo;chalk&rdquo;. 「加爾基」 is an archaic spelling; 「カルキ」 is far more common today. &para; The r&omacr;maji of 「精液」 and 「せいえき」 is &ldquo;seieki&rdquo; (「セ゚イエキ」 in katakana). The official katakana uses its synonym 「ザーメン」, r&omacr;maji &ldquo;Z&amacr;men&rdquo;; this in turn is the correct pronunciation of the official romanization, which uses the German &ldquo;Samen&rdquo;.">Kalk Z&amacr;men Kuri no Hana</em> genuinely feels like it came out of nowhere and couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been made by a mere human; I&rsquo;ve joked before that its final track <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Kanji: 葬列; hiragana: そうれつ; Japanese for &ldquo;Funeral Procession&rdquo;">“Sōuretsu”</span> proves she&rsquo;s secretly a Time Lord. The equally exquisite orchestral pop album <em class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Kanji: 平成風俗; hiragana: へいせいふうぞく; literal translation: Heisei Customs; official translation: Japanese Manners">Heisei F&umacr;zoku</em> followed, and on <em class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Japanese: 三文ゴシップ; r&omacr;maji: sanmon goship&umacr;; literal translation: &ldquo;The Three-mon Gossip&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Threepenny Gossip&rdquo; would be a reasonable localization); official translation: &ldquo;Superficial Gossip&rdquo;">Sanmon Gossip</em>, no two songs sound remotely alike: she performs probably every major genre except reggae, country, bluegrass, or metal without any of it feeling misplaced. I doubt her influence is at all obvious in my own music, but I strive to emulate her adventurousness at all times. If at least this aspect of her music shines through in mine to at least some extent, I&rsquo;ll be satisfied.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Joanna Newsom</span>. An immensely skilled arranger and lyricist, and probably at least 25% of why I love the harp. I could write an entire essay just about the symbolism of <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Colleen&rdquo;</span>, I could get lost in the sound of <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Divers&rdquo;</span>, and I could listen to <em class="accent weight3">Ys</em> a hundred more times without uncovering everything its arrangements have to teach me. One of the few artists whose discography I could be persuaded to rank as flawless.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Steve Albini</span>. Given that my workflow is entirely digital, it may seem strange that I list one of the last four decades&rsquo; most noted proponents of analog technology as a profound influence. But I try to mimic analog sound as much as I can: I limit my use of dynamic range compression to instruments like drums and bass guitar, keep the overall dynamic range high, favor recreations of analog synthesizers like the CS-80, and deplore modern technologies like pitch correction. Even more importantly, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Albini</span> was a tireless advocate for the artists he worked for, continued to grow as a person into his twilight years, and kept working literally until the day he died. An irreplaceable giant in the music industry; his death will hurt for a long time.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Talking Heads</span>. I only realized earlier this year that my heavy use (some would say overuse) of arpeggiation has been an attempt to mimic <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Once in a Lifetime&rdquo;</span>. <em class="accent weight3">Remain in Light</em> remains one of the most perfect albums I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hearing, and I feel like I learn something new from it every time I return to it.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</span>. My use (several would say overuse) of crescendi is due above all else to my love of their music, which has brought me more comfort in dark times than I can put into words &ndash; ironically, without any at all on their part. Alongside <span class="toc-counter weight2">Uematsu</span> and one other artist mentioned below, they&rsquo;re most responsible for convincing me my music wouldn&rsquo;t need words to speak directly to listeners, and they&rsquo;re tied for my favorite rock act of all time.</li>

		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Genesis</span>. <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Phil Collins</strong> is why I use (many would say overuse) gated reverb on the drums of every song I ever make; <strong class="accent weight3 petitecaps">Tony Banks</strong>&rsquo; skill at modulation is a constant reminder that I haven&rsquo;t mastered every aspect of composition, but his keyboard-centric approach to songwriting has inspired me at every turn since I was a wee lad. The whole band, better than any other act I&rsquo;ve ever heard, manages the impossible feat of balancing sophistication and catchiness, and, contrary to popular misconception, did so throughout its entire career &ndash; the progressive rock sacred cow <em class="accent weight3">Selling England by the Pound</em> includes the pop songs <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;More Fool Me&rdquo;</span>, and their &ldquo;pop sellout&rdquo; album <em class="accent weight3">Invisible Touch</em> includes the progressive rock songs <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Domino&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The Brazilian&rdquo;</span>. The second part of the tie.</li>
		<li>
			<p class="upperpara"><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Death&shy;spell O&shy;me&shy;ga</span>. Sure&shy;ly my least ob&shy;vi&shy;ous (and like&shy;ly most con&shy;tro&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;al) pro&shy;found mu&shy;si&shy;cal in&shy;flu&shy;ence: try as I might to mi&shy;mic their com&shy;po&shy;si&shy;tion&shy;al style, it&rsquo;s in&shy;im&shy;it&shy;ab&shy;le, or at least re&shy;qui&shy;res far bet&shy;ter grasp of mu&shy;sic the&shy;o&shy;ry than mine &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve ne&shy;ver heard an&shy;y&shy;one else con&shy;vin&shy;cing&shy;ly im&shy;it&shy;ate it, ei&shy;ther, so I&rsquo;m con&shy;vinced it&rsquo;s the for&shy;mer. In any case, songs like <span class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">&ldquo;Tem&shy;pes&shy;tās īr&shy;ae&rdquo;</span> and <span class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">&ldquo;Nōn om&shy;ni&shy;a in su&shy;a lo&shy;cō cor&shy;rēc&shy;tō er&shy;ant&rdquo;</span>, at least in part, rep&shy;re&shy;sent my attempts to emulate their peculiar mix of dissonance and melody.</p>

			<p class="midpara">I&rsquo;ve <a href="reviews/deathspellomega.html" target="_blank" class="songlink underline noprintlink" rel="nofollow">re&shy;viewed their work at great length</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;aaronfreed<span class="breaker">.</span>github<span class="breaker">.</span>io<span class="breaker">/</span>reviews<span class="breaker">/</span>deathspellomega<span class="breaker">.</span>html&#10217;</span>, partly because I think it&rsquo;s of&shy;ten mis&shy;in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ted: I read it not as <em>prescription</em> (i.e., &ldquo;this is how things <em>should be</em>&rdquo;) but <em>diagnosis</em> (i.e., &ldquo;this is how things <em>actually are</em>&rdquo;). In this, I find they resemble another widely misunderstood writer, the <span class="weight3 accent">Marquis de Sade</span>, who follows only the novelist and antifascist philosopher <span class="accent weight3">Georges Bataille</span> on their list of literary inspirations. (Not only have they cited <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bataille</span> as such for over two decades, but 2005&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Diabolus absconditus&rdquo;</span> and 2007&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Fas &ndash; ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum</em> quote him at length.) And as long as we&rsquo;re discussing <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bataille</span>&rsquo;s influence, <em class="accent weight3">The Fur&shy;na&shy;ces of Pa&shy;lin&shy;ge&shy;ne&shy;si&shy;a</em> is one of the most el&shy;o&shy;quent mu&shy;si&shy;cal ca&shy;ta&shy;logues I&rsquo;ve encountered of modern political follies (rivalled only by <span class="accent weight3">Ash&shy;en&shy;spi&shy;re</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Hos&shy;tile Ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture</em>, <a href="reviews/hostilearchitecture.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink noprintlink" rel="nofollow">which I&rsquo;ve also re&shy;viewed at length</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;aaronfreed<span class="breaker">.</span>github<span class="breaker">.</span>io<span class="breaker">/</span>reviews<span class="breaker">/</span>hostilearchitecture<span class="breaker">.</span>html&#10217;</span>).</p>
			
			<p>Their biggest influence on this album, however, is likely being at least part&shy;ly res&shy;pon&shy;si&shy;ble for my use (most would say ov&shy;er&shy;use) of La&shy;tin, as whi&shy;le <em class="toc-counter weight2">Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em>&rsquo;s use of La&shy;tin was my strong&shy;est impetus to learn it, theirs was a not in&shy;sig&shy;ni&shy;fi&shy;cant sec&shy;on&shy;da&shy;ry mo&shy;ti&shy;va&shy;tor. (Please don&rsquo;t hold this against them.) The fi&shy;nal part of the tie.</p>

	<ul class="fixheight">
		<li><span class="accent weight4 petitecaps">Chris Christodoulou</span>. When I started writing game music, I figured there was no way I&rsquo;d mix or master my own material: if even <strong class="accent weight3">Mick Gordon</strong> doesn&rsquo;t do it, then who was I to attempt it? But I kept making rough mixes anyway. Learning that <span class="toc-counter weight2">Chris</span> mixes and masters his own music &ndash; which invariably sounds fantastic, with more layers than a wedding cake &ndash; was revelatory: it led me to believe maybe it was possible after all.
			<p class="midpara"><span class="toc-counter weight2">Chris</span>&rsquo; release of his stems (which I desperately wish more artists would do, while I&rsquo;m at it) has proved something of a Rosetta stone for me: not merely has it provided material for two fantastic mixes I&rsquo;ve now done incorporating his tracks &ndash; one of which, mashing up <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> (<a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/reviews/theraindropthatfelltothesky.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="underline songlink noprintlink">which I&rsquo;ve also reviewed</a><span class="noscreen linktext nohyphens"> &#10216;aaronfreed<span class="breaker">.</span>github<span class="breaker">.</span>io<span class="breaker">/</span>reviews<span class="breaker">/</span>theraindropthatfelltothesky<span class="breaker">.</span>html&#10217;</span>), <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Moisture De&shy;fi&shy;cit&rdquo;</span>, and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by&rdquo;</span>, is on this album &ndash; but it&rsquo;s shown me how his mixes are even denser than they sound and served as a how-to guide.</p>
			<p class="midpara">(For what it&rsquo;s worth, I received the following comments on <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> earlier this year: <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;Man, your mixing is so good; it feels like such a textured track.&rdquo;</span> I won&rsquo;t attribute this purely to <span class="toc-counter weight2">Chris</span>&rsquo; influence, especially since the song is explicitly a <span class="accent weight3">David Wise</span> tribute, but I doubt I&rsquo;d have spent so long trying to get the perfect mix if <span class="toc-counter weight2">Chris</span> hadn&rsquo;t convinced me it was possible.)</p>
			<p class="lowerpara">I can&rsquo;t hope to express how personally meaningful it is to me that <span class="toc-counter weight2">Chris</span> personally encouraged me to continue working with his material &ndash; the encouragement of such an influential and accomplished composer means more than I can possibly hope to express, but I am eternally grateful for it.</p>

				<blockquote class="toc-counter">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes.&hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rsquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rsquo; Duane just said, &lsquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</blockquote>
			
				(Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly <em>wrong</em>, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)

				<p class="upperpara">I like <em class="accent weight3">Chrono Cross</em> overall, but among all works I&rsquo;ve ever experienced across all media, I suspect the only work whose ending has infuriated me more is <em class="accent weight3">La La Land</em> (2016, dir. <span class="accent weight3">Damien Chazelle</span>) &ndash; though to be fair to <em class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Cross</em>, and to explain my complaints in as spoiler-free a manner as possible, <em class="toc-counter weight2">La La Land</em>&rsquo;s ending is flawed due to a writing misstep I still find incomprehensible (my stock comparison is to a mystery that ends immediately after introducing the killer, without providing a single hint as to their motives or even their personality traits), while <em class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Cross</em>&rsquo; is flawed because its devs literally ran out of time to finish it and had to relegate several planned plot twists to an end-of-game infodump.</p>
				
				<p class="midpara">I still contend that the ending is a major reason <em class="toc-counter weight2">La La Land</em> infamously lost the <span class="accent weight3">89th Academy Award for Best Picture</span> to <em class="accent weight3">Moonlight</em> (2016, dir. <span class="accent weight3">Barry Jenkins</span>). To this day, even though I greatly enjoyed the rest of <em class="toc-counter weight2">La La Land</em>, I&rsquo;ve been unable to sit through it again or even listen to its soundtrack &ndash; I found its ending&rsquo;s aftertaste <em>that</em> bitter. (Full dis&shy;clo&shy;sure: I went to school and worked on several plays with one of <em class="toc-counter weight2">Moonlight</em>&rsquo;s producers, and incidentally, it&rsquo;s my favourite film of all time &ndash; though not for that reason.)</p>

				<p class="midpara">My fix to <em class="toc-counter weight2">La La Land</em>&rsquo;s ending is quite simple: cut the time-skip epilogue. The questions it resolves didn&rsquo;t need to be resolved, and it raises vastly more questions than it answers &ndash; which would&rsquo;ve been fine for a second-act scene of a film like this, but not for its final scene: we&rsquo;re not exactly talking about <em class="accent weight3">Inception</em> (2010, dir. <span class="accent weight3">Christopher Nolan</span>) here. Unfortunately, my brain will not allow me to simply pretend it doesn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; as I alluded to in the previous paragraph, I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

				<p class="midpara">My fix to <em class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Cross</em>&rsquo; ending is potentially much more complicated, but the simplest plausible solution can be succinctly summarized as &ldquo;Hire back the original devs and give them the resources they need to tell the story they wanted to tell in the first place&rdquo; (which would be enormously expensive by &ldquo;1999 game dev&rdquo; standards, but is a drop in the bucket by &ldquo;2024 game dev&rdquo; standards).</p>

				<p class="lowerpara">Despite my complaints with its ending, though, I still think <em class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Cross</em> is a great game, and I&rsquo;m sure I could replay it without issue &ndash; it&rsquo;s just not the 10/10 classic <em class="accent weight3">Chrono Trigger</em> is. <em class="toc-counter weight2">Cross</em> definitely feels tonally quite different, too, which is one reason I have complaints about it <em>as a</em> <span class="toc-counter weight2">Chrono Trigger</span> <em>sequel</em>. The other reason is delving into spoiler territory, but again, in as spoiler-free a manner as I can manage, it has to do with how <em class="toc-counter weight2">Cross</em> handles <em class="toc-counter weight2">Trigger</em>&rsquo;s characters &ndash; or doesn&rsquo;t, as the case may be.</p>
