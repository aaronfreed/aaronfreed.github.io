<h1 class="centred" id="intro" style="margin-top: 24px;">Introduction</h1>

<p class="fixheight">This is a (still unfinished) collection of tracks I&rsquo;ve written for game soundtracks since 2023. They&rsquo;re currently all intended either for <em class="accent weight3">hellpak Vol. 2</em> or <em class="accent weight3">Tempus Irae Redux</em>, which are both forthcoming scenarios for <span class="accent weight3">Bungie</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Marathon</em> series, though I don&rsquo;t know for sure where they&rsquo;ll end up.</p>

<p class="fixheight">This album is <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/music/compositions2023-2024.html" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">free to listen to online</a>. I&rsquo;ve made it available in two forms: as <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgeo9dCMSz8QFVNaQTA?e=Oj7nWw" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">individual tracks</a> and as an <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgepQ8YKVbwhuZ6T8gQ?e=rgiALy" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">album image with an embedded cuesheet</a> (any media player worth its salt should be able to read the individual songs within the latter). I also provide cuesheets (for both the individual tracks and the album image) that split the songs into individual movements, should anyone wish to do so.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Please <a href="aboutme.html" class="underline songlink">ask me for permission</a> before using its tracks for your own use, though. (You&rsquo;re also welcome to <a href="aboutme.html" class="underline songlink">contact me</a> with questions/praise/constructive criticism/job offers.)</p>

<p class="fixheight noprint">Click on any track name in the tracklist to jump to my commentary about that track; click on its title in the commentary to listen to it. After this example, <span class="underline" style="text-decoration-color: color-mix(in srgb, currentcolor 66.66667%, transparent); text-underline-offset: 2px;">a solid underline</span> on this page will always denote a link (though I haven&rsquo;t underlined all links); <span class="dotted" title="This is a tooltip">a dotted underline</span> signifies text that you may hover your mouse over for further information. Frequently, though not always, this includes translations of foreign terms or names, or further commentary on links I&rsquo;ve provided. (I realize this isn&rsquo;t ideal for accessibility and plan to work on a solution eventually, but I&rsquo;ve already spent long enough on this page and just want to publish it.)</p>

<p class="fixheight">I link to YouTube videos of most songs I mention by other artists. I usually link to the original studio album releases of rock songs, though I occasionally link to music videos or notable live performances as well. Likewise, I usually link to the OST versions of game tracks, with a few specific exceptions:</p>

<ul class="fixheight">
	<li>For <span class="weight3 accent">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight2 toc-counter">SNES</span>-era <em class="weight3 accent">Final Fantasy</em> soundtracks (<em class="weight2 toc-counter">FFIV</em>, <em class="weight2 toc-counter">FFV</em>, and <em class="weight2 toc-counter">FFVI</em>), I link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKqNek98rqpapwTTGxjTGjQ" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">Mathew Valente</a>&rsquo;s <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Synthetic Origins</em> remakes, which employ the original synthesizers Uematsu used to compose the tracks without the compression required to fit their voices on a <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Super Famicom</span> cartridge; in other words, they&rsquo;re the songs remade with the sounds Uematsu would&rsquo;ve heard when he was writing them.</li>
	<li>For <span class="weight3 accent">David Wise</span>&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent">Donkey Kong Country</em> soundtracks, I link to both the OST versions (since I mention how skilfully Wise used the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">SNES</span>&rsquo; sound chip) and to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKaTWjXt6tJ9S6K0YFJVEfQ" class="underline songlink" target="_blank">Jammin&rsquo; Sam Miller</a>&rsquo;s remakes, which follow exactly the same ethos as <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Synthetic Origins</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fixheight">For classical music, if I know the performance date, conductor, or orchestra, I list it in a tooltip.</p>

<p class="fixheight">Lastly, the &ldquo;DR&rdquo; scores are measures of songs&rsquo; dynamic range, created with the <span class="weight3 accent">TT Dynamic Range Meter</span> plugin for <span class="weight3 accent">foobar2000</span>. (This plugin apparently has not been available for download in years &ndash; I&rsquo;m currently seeking the best available alternative and will provide a link to it once I locate it.) The higher the score, the higher a song&rsquo;s dynamic range. Music from the last 20 years tends to score in the DR5&ndash;DR7 range &ndash; thus, this album is both more dynamic and quieter than most modern music. Use your volume knob if necessary.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">While writing this movement, I briefly thought I&rsquo;d rewritten <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Main Theme of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>&rdquo;</span>; then I played it back and realized I hadn&rsquo;t, which resulted in this song&rsquo;s admittedly bizarre title. At this point, writing a pastiche of <span class="weight3 accent">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s music felt inevitable, so I leaned into it and gave what became its three movements cheeky titles based on their obvious inspirations.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Since I hadn&rsquo;t fully settled on this being a <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> pastiche when I wrote it, this movement probably has the most distinct identity. Despite its relative melodic and harmonic simplicity, its arrangement goes through several major changes that hopefully will keep it engaging. The transition at the end is probably this movement&rsquo;s most complicated and unexpected aspect.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This was, believe it or not, supposed to be merely a study in 5:4 polyrhythms (which is distinct from, though in this case coincidentally linked to, 5/4 time signatures). However, the bass line I wrote for this movement steadfastly refused to work in anything except groups of seven (<a href="https://marathon.bungie.org/story/seven.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">yes Hamish</a>), and the <a href="https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">Oblique Strategies</a> suggested keeping it that way, so I began this song with the extraordinarily unusual 7:5 polyrhythm. Groups of 6 and 4 naturally worked their way in as I wrote additional instrument parts, hence the song&rsquo;s title.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For those curious, I actually notated this as 4/4 in Logic, so much like <span class="toc-counter weight2">Meshuggah</span>, I could truthfully claim the mind-warping polyrhythms I&rsquo;ve created here are entirely in 4/4. However, I don&rsquo;t actually <em>feel</em> it as 4/4; I usually feel it either as 5/4 or as 7/4, depending on whether I&rsquo;m focusing more on the drums or the bass.</p>

I felt I&rsquo;d been melodically aping <span class="accent weight3">Alex Seropian</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> (from <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>) and <span class="accent weight3">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Those Who Fight Further&rdquo;</span> (from <em class="toc-counter weight2">Final Fantasy VII</em>) for most of this movement anyway, so I quoted each of them for eighteen seconds near the end of the movement.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">The Mellotron introduces this new movement&rsquo;s chords before the bass enters, followed by the organ and two different guitar parts. The bass line repeatedly suggests <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Chomber&rdquo;</span> from <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> &ndash; since I was writing this for a <em>Marathon</em> scenario and had by this point settled on using groupings of seven for the bass parts throughout the entire track, the reference felt obligatory. However, I always throw some additional notes into the mix.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Guitar and bass rarely engage in counterpoint in rock music. I love counterpoint and would love to hear more of it, so I wrote the guitar part as a counterpoint to the bass line. I&rsquo;m extremely pleased with the effect; it almost sounds like a rock fugue.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">Midway through this movement, I add strings and some ethereal <em class="weight3 accent">Dark Side of the Moon</em>-style choral vocals that end up being the song&rsquo;s final elements as the others stop playing. (Before adding the strings, I&rsquo;d begun writing a fourth movement that I yeeted after noticing that it was virtually identical to <span class="weight3 accent">Chris Christodoulou</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/67BwWgrMlxk" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Coalescence</a>&rdquo;</span> [<em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em>, 2013].)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve never played a <em class="accent weight3">Donkey Kong Country</em> game and, to my knowledge, hadn&rsquo;t heard any of its brilliant music until <span class="dotted" title="June 11, 2024, in ISO 8601 (the objectively correct date format)">2024-06-11</span>. I note this because any <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> fan will immediately peg <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> as an unapologetic tribute to its most famous track, <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. (Right down to its title, in fact: <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Ambi&emacr;ns aqu&amacr;tica&rdquo;</span> is Latin for <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span>. I see little point in concealing my influences.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I grew up listening to <span class="accent weight3">David Wise</span>&rsquo;s music; I played the NES <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marble Madness</em> ad nauseam as a child, plus <em class="toc-counter weight2">California Games</em> and likely <em class="toc-counter weight2">Battletoads</em> and maybe a few other games he worked on as well. But Wise&rsquo;s reputation primarily rests on his <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em> soundtracks, and with good reason: they use the <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>&rsquo;s limited sound chip as virtuosically as <span class="toc-counter weight2">Square</span>&rsquo;s greatest 16-bit composers (<span class="toc-counter weight2">Hiroki Kikuta</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Yasunori Mitsuda</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Y&omacr;ko Shimomura</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Nobuo Uematsu</span>, etc.) did. If the <span class="toc-counter weight2">Follin brothers</span> hadn&rsquo;t existed, they&rsquo;d be the absolute upper echelon in this category. On which note, R.I.P. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Geoff</span> :(</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I first heard <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> in a <a href="https://youtu.be/4DgPmI6S_So" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">video</a> jazz pianist <span class="toc-counter weight2">Charles Cornell</span> ostensibly made about <span class="toc-counter weight2">K&omacr;ji Kond&omacr;</span>&rsquo;s (also brilliant) music for <em class="toc-counter weight2">Super Mario 64</em>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Dire, Dire Docks&rdquo;</span>. Cornell actually spent more than half its runtime gushing about Wise&rsquo;s track, and I immediately understood why; it struck a nerve on a primal level. Not only did I know, on first listen, that it was a masterpiece, but I immediately wanted to write a more energetic track with an otherwise similar mood &ndash; which is not an urge I frequently get.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">So, having heard Wise&rsquo;s piece probably no more than twice, I sat down, put its first two chords (which Cornell had analyzed in detail) into <span class="toc-counter weight2">Logic Pro</span>&rsquo;s arpeggiator, wrote a chord progression that felt like a natural follow-up, and sketched out the melodies and arrangement overnight. I&rsquo;d already finished a rough mix by sunrise of 2024-06-12. I&rsquo;ve since added a few background embellishments, but the fundaments are unchanged.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">It&rsquo;s rare (get it? because <em class="toc-counter weight2">Donkey Kong Country</em>&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">developer</a> is&hellip; never mind) for a song to emerge almost fully formed so quickly for me; usually, <em>something</em> about my first attempt doesn&rsquo;t work, but this just flowed out of me (if you&rsquo;ll pardon the obvious water metaphor) as an expression of my contemporary emotional and mental state. I felt particularly alienated by the conduct of certain individuals in the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em> community: one of my closest friends (who&rsquo;s seriously ill) had poured eighteen months into tutoring me for apparently fruitless ends. (I&rsquo;ve withheld names and further specifics to protect the <del>innocent</del> guilty, but we ultimately <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-Bet-Marathon/alephbet" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">forked the engine</a>.) It is not strictly incorrect to read this song as a reflection of my existential despair at the time.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Aquatic Ambiance&rdquo;</span> is obviously one of the best game tracks of all time, and in no way do I think I&rsquo;ve duplicated its quality &ndash; especially because, again, Wise was doing all of that on a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Super Nintendo</span>! To avoid plagiarism (<a href="https://youtu.be/UQHaGhC7C2E" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">a famous Russian mathematician&rsquo;s contrary advice</a> aside), I didn&rsquo;t listen to Wise&rsquo;s piece again until I finished writing mine &ndash; and when I did, I was pretty astonished at how closely I&rsquo;d approximated its mood and atmosphere. I hardly consider myself an unbiased source, so I&rsquo;ll quote one of my early listeners:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight">&ldquo;I think you really captured the spirit of the OG while still giving it a danceable (beat, rhythm, etc. &ndash; not sure on the vocab). It&rsquo;s got more energy than the source material :)&rdquo;</blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight">So I&rsquo;ll chalk that one up as a success.</p>

		<p class="toc-counter centred fixheight">composer: <span class="accent weight3">Aaron Freed</span>, 2024</p>

		<ol class="shortmargin" style="font-size: 18px;">

		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">This song was an experiment in two different ways:</p>

		<ol class="normal fixheight">
			<li>I was experimenting with <span class="accent weight3">Logic Pro</span>&rsquo;s new session bassist and session keyboardist (thus the subtitle)</li>
			<li>I was seeking to answer a question no one had asked, &ldquo;Does disco need a 4/4 time signature to feel like disco?&rdquo; (The answer, surprisingly, is no.)</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">Logic&rsquo;s session keyboardists are&hellip; well, they&rsquo;re quite good at coming up with jazzy accompaniments, but you couldn&rsquo;t rely on them to come up with the main melodies of a track. The session bassist, though, is unbelievably good &ndash; the performance is full of realistic-sounding slides and unbelievable hooks. I&rsquo;d already relied heavily on the session drummer in my previous arrangements &ndash; I&rsquo;m not a drummer, and whenever I write drum parts myself, they feel less natural to me than the parts I&rsquo;ve created with Logic&rsquo;s session drummer. The bassist is even better than that.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Logic&rsquo;s session players all require substantial user input to get the kinds of performances found here; users must, at the bare minimum, specify chords and performance styles. There are also parameters for the rhythmic patterns the session players use; the complexity, intensity, and dynamic range of their performances; the melodic range of the bassist and keyboardist&rsquo;s performances; how much swing they use; how much they deviate from the metronome (&ldquo;humanize&rdquo;); how in front of or behind the beat they play (&ldquo;feel&rdquo;); the frequency and complexity of their fills; what kinds of arpeggiation the &ldquo;arpeggiated&rdquo; keyboardist performs; the kind of voicings the keyboardist plays with each hand; how many grace notes the keyboardist performs; how many ghost notes the drummer performs; how many notes and what kind of grooves the bassist performs; how many slides, blue notes, and dead notes the bassist performs; and more beyond that. I always customize all of these &ndash; in particular, I usually crank &ldquo;complexity&rdquo;, &ldquo;fill amount&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fill complexity&rdquo; all the way up.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The first half of this song features a steadily building arrangement that I wrote for the OST, but the structure heard here will not necessarily match what players hear in the game exactly. As players complete mission objectives in the level this track will appear in, the game will add melodic layers to the existing arrangement. Thus, the music will get louder and more complex as players progress through the level.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">That said, I was impressed enough with Logic&rsquo;s session musicians that I decided to feature them without my added accompaniments for the second half of the song &ndash; it feels like a modern structural equivalent of extended 12&rdquo; disco mixes that used to feature lengthy instrumental breakdowns towards the end.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The song title is a take-off on a movement of <span class="accent weight3">Genesis</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/9hKYpNpajpI" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Supper&rsquo;s Ready</a>&rdquo;</span>, namely <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8 (co-starring the delicious talents of Gabble Ratchet)&rdquo;</span>. I began using this title semi-ironically, but the more I thought about it, the more it felt appropriate. For one thing, its chord progression strongly resembles one I used in a song I performed on my <em><a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/music/demos2014.html" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">Demos 2014</a></em> album that I named simply <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span>. I habitually used to perform <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span> after covering an excerpt of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span> that doesn&rsquo;t strictly belong to either <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> or to its preceding movement, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Willow Farm&rdquo;</span> &ndash; in fact, it appears on <em class="toc-counter weight2">Demos 2014</em> in that exact format. So, effectively, if <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Love&rdquo;</span> used to take the place of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span> when I covered a segment of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rdquo;</span>, then it feels appropriate to name a track with a similar chord progression after <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Apocalypse in 9/8&rdquo;</span>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The other major inspiration on this feels too obvious to note, but I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway: <span class="accent weight3">Nobuo Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: &#x300C;プレ&#x30EA;ュード&#x300D;, &ldquo;Purery&umacr;do&rdquo; (note: this link is to Mathew Valente&rsquo;s excellent restoration of the Final Fantasy VI arrangement)">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/albC3EHqeL4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Prelude</a>&rdquo;</span> from the <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> series. I&rsquo;m noting it because, until I began watching <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: スタジオジ&#x30D6;&#x30EA; (Sutajio Jiburi)">Studio Ghibli</span>&rsquo;s filmography from start to finish in 2024, I didn&rsquo;t realize how large an influence <span class="dotted accent weight3" title="Japanese: 久石 譲, Hisaishi J&omacr;; stage name of &#34276;澤 守 (Fujisawa Mamoru)">Joe Hisaishi</span> had so many Japanese composers. I&rsquo;d liken the experience to that of a person who&rsquo;d only listened to Western pop music from the last 50 years for their entire life finally hearing <span class="accent weight3">the Beatles</span>. None of the composers I&rsquo;d listened to bothered mentioning Hisaishi as an influence because &ndash; well, wasn&rsquo;t it obvious? As it turned out, not to people who hadn&rsquo;t heard him. So, while the influence of <span class="toc-counter weight2">Uematsu</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Prelude&rdquo;</span> is no doubt obvious to those familiar with the <em class="toc-counter weight2">Final Fantasy</em> series&rsquo; music, I&rsquo;ll point it out anyway.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Two different versions of the same song, written in <span class="toc-counter weight2">Phrygian mode</span>, which has an intrinsic Spanish feeling to it due to the flat second note of its scale. Most of it&rsquo;s in 7/4, but it changes to 5/4 (on two separate occasions) for roughly half a minute of chords that I basically lifted verbatim from <span class="accent weight3">Mozart</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Requiem</em> &ndash; which is thematically appropriate, given the events of the story in the game level I&rsquo;ve written this song for. The final four measures of the Mozart quote are in 4/4.

		<p class="fixheight"><span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;D&omacr;n&amacr; e&imacr; requiem&rdquo;</span> is a softer arrangement of <span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;Pfhor Pfh&omacr;r&imacr; lupus&rdquo;</span> with the guitar and electric cello replaced with flute and oboe, respectively; most other instruments except the string quartet stripped away; a fretless bass replacing the electric; and a completely different drum track.

		<p class="fixheight">A weird experiment that I&rsquo;ve nonetheless grown quite fond of. It&rsquo;s ancient Greek (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">Ho thr&ecirc;nos t&ecirc;s Lokr&iacute;dos</em>) for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Locrian Lament&rdquo;</span> (more literally, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;The Lament of Locris&rdquo;</span>), so named because it&rsquo;s written, to the extent one can manage to do so, in the <span class="accent weight3">Locrian mode</span>. Of the major scale&rsquo;s seven modes, Locrian is the only one with a diminished root chord &ndash; thus, where its counterparts&rsquo; root chords are based on the consonant interval of the perfect fifth, Locrian&rsquo;s is based on the tritone, an interval <span id="ftnt_ref03" class="dotted" title="However, claims that the tritone was banned in medieval harmony or that composers or singers could be excommunciated for using it are urban legends. Although heavily discouraged, it was never banned.  &para;  Also, &lsquo;diabolus in music&amacr;&rsquo; can refer to other intervals; the tritone is merely its most common referent.">dissonant enough to be associated with the phrase <em class="toc-counter weight2" lang="la">diabolus in music&amacr;</em> (Latin: <em class="toc-counter weight2">the devil in music</em>).<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt03" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&sup3;&#8318;</a></span> This has some interesting side effects:</p>

		<ol class="normal fixheight">
			<li>Very few songs written in Locrian <em>stay</em> in Locrian for their entire running time. This is likely no exception.</li>

			<li>As a result of this, Locrian is great for establishing not just an unsettling atmosphere, but a sense that we&rsquo;re never truly at &ldquo;home&rdquo;, or at least don&rsquo;t stay there for long.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="fixheight">That&rsquo;s not even getting into the time signature shenanigans: the first measure is 1/8, the second is 2/8, the third is 3/8, the fourth is 4/8, and so on, down to measure 21, which is 21/8. Then the cycle repeats. So if you thought this track was intentionally rhythmically disorienting&hellip; you&rsquo;re right. It is.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For all of that, this track&rsquo;s second movement is surprisingly chill. Locrian mode is full of paradoxes. The first movement is suitably frantic, but I had to work harder than I expected to get it to sound that way.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The Locrian mode roughly equates to the ancient Greeks&rsquo; diatonic Mixolydian tonos; our Mixolydian mode roughly equals their diatonic Hypophrygian tonos. Several of our other mode names are also historically inaccurate; I go into much greater detail <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/musicalmodes.html#etymology" class="weight3 underline songlink">on my website</a>. </p>

		<p class="fixheight">This feels relatively close to finished now. After the player finishes the mission, I&rsquo;ll strip away several of the layers after the player finishes the mission, hence the subdued outro I&rsquo;ve prepared for the OST mix. (These will be two completely separate audio files for the in-game version.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The guitar in the first movement&rsquo;s left channel quotes <span class="accent weight3">Rush</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3 dotted" id="ftnt_ref01c" title="Pronunciation etiquette note: Rush are Canadian and named this instrumental after the three-letter code for the Toronto airport, so &lsquo;Z&rsquo; is pronounced &lsquo;zed&rsquo;, not &lsquo;zee&rsquo;. (The opening riff spells out &lsquo;YYZ&rsquo; in Morse code. It also happens to live rent-free in my head, which is why I&rsquo;ve quoted it so many times.) Also, the drummer&rsquo;s surname is pronounced &lsquo;Peert&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Pert&rsquo;.">&ldquo;YYZ&rdquo;<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt01" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>. The guitar in the right channel quotes <a href="https://youtu.be/Nnuq9PXbywA?t=150" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">the opening of the fugue</a> from <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span>&rsquo;s famous <span class="accent weight3"><em class="weight4">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</em>, BWV 565</span>. This is actually the second time I&rsquo;ve quoted both these compositions in the same track; my <a href="https://youtu.be/bRiDh3PziWU?t=495" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">arrangement</a> of <span class="accent weight3">Alex Seropian</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Marathon</em>, 1994) does the same thing. I&rsquo;d like to claim that I did this on purpose, but it didn&rsquo;t occur to me until after I&rsquo;d already done it. The Bach quote, incidentally, is one of the few times I broke from strictly adhering to the scale of B Locrian &ndash; it sounded wrong without the accidentals.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&tau;&#8112;&rho;&#8112;&chi;&#974;&delta;&eta;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">tarakh&#7763;d&emacr;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">chaotic</em> in ancient Greek, while <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&#972;&varsigma;&rdquo;</span> (romanized: <em class="toc-counter weight2">gal&emacr;n&oacute;s</em>) means <em class="toc-counter weight2">peaceful</em>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Additional note for you math nerds out there: the pitch ratio of a perfect fifth is approximately 3:2, and the pitch ratio of a perfect fourth (the interval needed to complete the octave above a perfect fifth) is <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref04" title="More precisely, in twelve-tone equal temperament, the basis of modern Western instrument tuning (wherein every note has 2^(1/12), or &asymp; 1.05946309436, times the next lowest note&rsquo;s pitch), a perfect fifth&rsquo;s ratio is 2^(7/12):1, or &asymp; 1.49830707688:1 (cf. 3/2 = 1.5), while a perfect fourth&rsquo;s is 2^(5/12):1, or &asymp; 1.33483985417 (cf. 4/3 = 1.333333&hellip;). Twelve-tone equal temperament very likely became so widely adopted due to being the smallest equal temperament that includes such close approximations of 3:2 and 4:3, which have been regarded at least since Pythagoras&rsquo; day as fundamental ratios of musical harmony.">approximately 4:3.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt04" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8308;&#8318;</a></span> The tritone, meanwhile, has a ratio of exactly &radic;<span class="radical-number">2</span>:1.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Finally, a few notes regarding <span class="toc-counter weight2">Bach</span>, who is undoubtedly still my biggest musical influence: this Wikipedia paragraph on the reception of <em class="toc-counter weight2">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</em> might as well be the opening of <span class="accent weight3">Charles Dickens</span>&rsquo; <em class="accent weight3">A Tale of Two Cities</em>:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight">The composition has been deemed both &ldquo;particularly suited to the organ&rdquo; and &ldquo;strikingly unorganistic&rdquo;. It has been seen as united by a single ground-thought, but also as containing &ldquo;passages which have no connection whatever with the chief idea&rdquo;. It has been called &ldquo;entirely a thing of virtuosity&rdquo; yet also described as being &ldquo;not so difficult as it sounds&rdquo;. It has been described as some sort of program music depicting a storm, but also as abstract music, quite the opposite of program music depicting a storm. It has been presented as an emanation of the galant style, yet too dramatic to be anything near that style. Its period of origin has been assumed to have been as early as around 1704, and as late as the 1750s. Its defining characteristics have been associated with extant compositions by Bach (BWV 531, 549a, 578, 911, 914, 922 and several of the solo violin sonatas and partitas), and by others (including Nicolaus Bruhns and Johann Heinrich Buttstett), as well as with untraceable earlier versions for other instruments and/or by other composers. It has been deemed too simplistic for it to have been written down by Bach, and too much a stroke of genius to have been composed by anyone else but Bach.</blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight">In short, it was a composition <del>very much like th</del> I&rsquo;m sorry; I can&rsquo;t even finish typing that with a straight face.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">For the record, I&rsquo;ve performed the toccata in its entirety on both piano and pipe organ and didn&rsquo;t find it especially difficult (this was 25 years ago, so I don&rsquo;t have a recording; sorry). I also find it far too ingenious to <em>not</em> be by Bach, but then, I was taught <span class="accent weight3">Christian Petzold</span>&rsquo;s <span class="toc-counter weight2 dotted" id="ftnt_ref05" title="Performance by Lang Lang (Chinese: &#37070;&#26391;; pinyin: L&aacute;ng L&#462;ng); also includes Petzold&rsquo;s less famous Minuet in G minor, BWV Anh. 115, which is part of a pair with BWV Anh. 114, and which I think I actually like more. Lang also comments on why both minuets are works of genius, and why they&rsquo;re such fantastic pieces for beginners to learn.  &para;  BWV Anh. stands for &ldquo;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis Anhang&rdquo;, German for &ldquo;Bach-Works-Catalogue Annex&rdquo;, &ldquo;a list of lost, doubtful, or spurious compositions by, or once attributed to, Johann Sebastian Bach&rdquo; (Wikipedia)."><span class="accent weight3"><a href="https://youtu.be/hw19cy5bV6E" target="_blank" class="underline songlink">Minuet in G</a>,</span> <span lang="de-de">BWV Anh. 114</span>,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt05" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8309;&#8318;</a></span> as a Bach piece and was shocked to learn the attribution to Bach was spurious (and was known to be when I was taught it &ndash; pedagogy took a long time to catch up with scholarship).

		<p class="fixheight toc-counter centred">composer: <span class="accent weight3">Aaron Freed</span>, 2024</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I stole this song&rsquo;s rhythm from <span class="accent weight3">the Allman Brothers Band</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span> (studio: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/nfrSIUE3iAE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Allman Brothers Band</a></em>, 1969; definitive live recording: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/4ppYldfTMiE" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">At Fillmore East</a></em>, 1971), likely the most famous use of 11/8 in rock history (despite its composer <span class="toc-counter weight2">Gregg Allman</span> <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref06" title="Per the man himself: &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t feel one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes. &hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rdquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rdquo; Duane just said, &ldquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rdquo;&rsquo;  &para;  (Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly wrong, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)">apparently not understanding this<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt06" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8310;&#8318;</a></span>), so if it feels slightly off-kilter rhythmically, that&rsquo;s entirely intentional. A few of its chords may be similar to those of <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Whipping Post&rdquo;</span>, too. Another big influence is undoubtedly <span class="accent weight3">Led Zeppelin</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight2">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/w772GXG5LnE" target="_blank" class="underlin songlink">Dazed and Confused</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Led Zeppelin</em>, 1969).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">However, it sounds quite different from either &ndash; despite the fairly metal-influenced (synthesized) guitar solo towards the end, it has a major jazz fusion/progressive electronic vibe, despite paradoxically having virtually no blue notes and sticking fairly strictly to the <span class="toc-counter weight2">D Dorian</span> scale. It&rsquo;s also quite a bit more unpredictable and even chaotic than what I set out to make. A friend described it as sounding like <em class="accent weight3">Final Fantasy</em> boss fight music, which feels entirely accurate. My mother also compared it to <span class="accent weight3">Tears for Fears</span>&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Sowing the Seeds of Love&rdquo;</span> (album mix: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/XEQKy8g5UK4" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Seeds of Love</a></em>, 1989; the <a href="https://youtu.be/VAtGOESO7W8" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">music video</a> is a minute shorter), which also feels accurate (<em class="toc-counter weight2">The Seeds of Love</em>, a lost classic of the late &rsquo;80s, has been one of my favorite albums for 35 years).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The title is a pun on the Dorian mode by way of <span class="accent weight3">Oscar Wilde</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> &ndash; a sort of song title equivalent of Cockney rhyming slang.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I feel almost certain that I&rsquo;ll write at least one more movement of this track (perhaps preceding the first one), and I have absolutely no idea where it&rsquo;s going.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I actually began writing this song before all of the tracks on this album except &ldquo;Not Actually FFIV&rdquo; and &ldquo;7:6:5:4&rdquo;, but it didn&rsquo;t actually turn into a <em>song</em> until significantly later. It is still, in fact, nowhere near done.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">&ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo; is so named because it evolved from a mathematical pattern. I started with a series of notes, wherein the lowest note would play twice as often as the second-lowest note, three times as often as the third-lowest note, four times as often as the fourth-lowest note, and so on. I arranged these into chords and threw a disco beat and bass line over them. It goes kinda hard, tbh. About midway through, &ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo; switches to 5/4, but doesn&rsquo;t actually become any less disco (see above for further experiments in this).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The guitar solo in &ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo; remains a work in progress, but it quotes <span class="accent weight3">Edvard Grieg</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;In the Hall of the Mountain King&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Peer Gynt</em>, 1875), very likely the most famous Norwegian composition in history and &ndash; more to the point &ndash; the most famous use of a continually increasing tempo in musical history. For that exact reason, I did something unexpected: I slowed down the second half of my quote. (This was partly to fit the existing chord progression, but it was also pure contrarianism.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">While mixing &ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo;, I was sufficiently captivated by its solo keyboard parts to isolate them and make them the central part of a new track, named &ldquo;Fractal Jazz&rdquo; for obvious reasons (though it also wouldn&rsquo;t feel out-of-place in a late-&rsquo;90s/early-&rsquo;00s JRPG soundtrack). For the OST, I&rsquo;ve merged them into a single track; in-game, &ldquo;Fractal Dance&rdquo; will likely crossfade into &ldquo;Fractal Jazz&rdquo; after the level objective is completed.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Another work in progress. I wrote most of this while Hurricane Debby was passing overhead. Logic Pro&rsquo;s Latin percussionist, which I used on this track, has a preset called &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo;. The title was predestined.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Overall, this is an experiment in tonality &ndash; many of the above tracks stuck strictly to the mode they were written in, at least for much of their running time. In this case, I was going for something that seesawed between being more dissonant than Locrian mode and being quite melodic. It&rsquo;s too early to know whether I&rsquo;ve succeeded, but the results seem promising.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Clima tempestuosa&rdquo; is Spanish for &ldquo;Stormy Weather&rdquo;. (What else was I going to call the acoustic version?)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I may be the only person that actually hears this, but this song is vaguely inspired by <span class="accent weight3">System of a Down</span>&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/CSvFpBOe8eY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">&ldquo;Chop Suey!&rdquo;</a> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Toxicity</em>, 2001). The biggest tells are that, like its inspiration, it&rsquo;s in G minor and makes heavy use of start-stop dynamics. It turned into something quite different, though.</p>
		
		<p class="fixheight">The other vague inspiration I can name is <span class="accent weight3">Radiohead</span>&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/Q29iibXXiOs" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">&ldquo;In Limbo&rdquo;</a> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Kid A</em>, 2000), another song that lives rent-free in my head (actually, most of that album does). Whenever I hear a <span class="toc-counter weight2">Fender Rhodes</span> play a fuguelike melody, that song immediately comes to mind.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I didn&rsquo;t even try to make the jazz arrangement of this song similar to the metal version, apart from its chord progression &ndash; in fact, they have no instrument parts in common. In this case, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a problem: the transitions within the metal movement are meant to be jarring, so why shouldn&rsquo;t the transition to jazz <em>also</em> come out of nowhere?</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This is probably the furthest from being finished in this collection (hence its brief runtime), but I&rsquo;m already pleased enough with the segments I&rsquo;ve composed to include it. I think this piece will end up being relatively short, anyway &ndash; stretching it out for too long would probably spoil the effect.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This track ex&shy;ists al&shy;most en&shy;ti&shy;re&shy;ly be&shy;cause Chris per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me to make it. I&rsquo;m not sure I can ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly ex&shy;press how mean&shy;ing&shy;ful and re&shy;war&shy;ding that is to me.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">A few days be&shy;fore I be&shy;gan wor&shy;king on this track, I&rsquo;d sent him a mash-up I&rsquo;d made of <span class="accent weight3">wow&shy;bob&shy;wow</span>&rsquo;s ar&shy;range&shy;ment of <span class="accent weight3">Al&shy;ex Se&shy;ro&shy;pi&shy;an</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/dcWHHYsoNk8?t=849" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">Lan&shy;ding</a>&rdquo;</span> (<em class="toc-counter weight2">Ma&shy;ra&shy;thon</em>, 1994) with Chris&rsquo; <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/EGXPAoyP_cg" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">The Rain For&shy;mer&shy;ly Known as Pur&shy;ple</a>&rdquo;</span> and <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/RffBrCLOKv0" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">A Gla&shy;cier E&shy;ven&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly Farts (and Don&rsquo;t You Lis&shy;ten to the Song of Life)</a>.&rdquo;</span> (Chris&rsquo; song ti&shy;tle game puts mine to shame.) Chris liked it and pro&shy;vi&shy;ded se&shy;ve&shy;ral con&shy;struc&shy;tive sug&shy;ges&shy;tions that I&rsquo;m sure will im&shy;prove the song im&shy;mense&shy;ly the next time I get around to wor&shy;king on it. I also men&shy;tioned that I wan&shy;ted to at&shy;tempt a few further mash-ups; he seemed to find that idea mo&shy;der&shy;ate&shy;ly in&shy;ter&shy;es&shy;ting, but he di&shy;rect&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me to try to write some&shy;thing en&shy;tire&shy;ly new based on the OST stems. (Just the fact that he re&shy;leased the OST stems at all is awe&shy;some, I have to add.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;d con&shy;si&shy;dered that idea se&shy;ve&shy;ral times be&shy;fore then, and ev&shy;e&shy;ry time I&rsquo;d done so, I&rsquo;d felt too in&shy;ti&shy;mi&shy;da&shy;ted to try. But since Chris had per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ly en&shy;cour&shy;aged me, I put that a&shy;side and load&shy;ed four stems from <a href="https://youtu.be/eQyP7qocptY" target="_blank" class="underline songlink weight3">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</a> in&shy;to Logic: the lead me&shy;lo&shy;dy, the drum and per&shy;cus&shy;sion tracks, and the bass guitar. I then at&shy;temp&shy;ted to write my own chords and ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ni&shy;ment and was shocked at:</p>

				<ol class="loweralpha normal fixheight">
					<li>how na&shy;tu&shy;ral&shy;ly I came up with sub&shy;stan&shy;tial&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent chords for most of the me&shy;lo&shy;dy</li>
					<li>how com&shy;plete&shy;ly dif&shy;fer&shy;ent its mood felt</li>
					<li>how in&shy;com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sib&shy;ly sub&shy;lime the result felt</li>
				</ol>

				<p class="fixheight">To be fair, part of this is be&shy;cause Chris&rsquo; work is on another level. (I al&shy;rea&shy;dy men&shy;tioned in an end&shy;note for <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;Not Ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly FFIV&rdquo;</span> that <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is now tied with <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="kanji: &#26893;&#26494; &#20280;&#22827;; hiragana: &#12358;&#12360;&#12414;&#12388; &#12398;&#12406;&#12362;; r&omacr;maji: Uematsu Nobuo">No&shy;bu&shy;o U&shy;e&shy;mat&shy;su</span>&rsquo;s <span class="accent weight3 dotted" title="Japanese: &#x5996;&#x661F;&#x4E71;&#x821E; (Y&omacr;sei Ranbu), literally &ldquo;Wild Dance of the Ominous Star&rdquo;">&ldquo;Dan&shy;cing Mad&rdquo;</span> as my fa&shy;vor&shy;ite piece ever writ&shy;ten for a vi&shy;de&shy;o game.)</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I did find my&shy;self stumped when I got to what, for lack of a bet&shy;ter word, I&rsquo;ll call the break&shy;down about four min&shy;utes into the piece. I&rsquo;ve ef&shy;fec&shy;tive&shy;ly co&shy;pied the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;al chords, be&shy;cause ev&shy;en af&shy;ter trans&shy;crib&shy;ing the me&shy;lo&shy;dy and har&shy;mo&shy;ny for that seg&shy;ment by ear, the the&shy;o&shy;ry be&shy;hind it con&shy;founds me. Every chord I&rsquo;ve tried there be&shy;sides the or&shy;ig&shy;in&shy;als has felt com&shy;plete&shy;ly off. I don&rsquo;t un&shy;der&shy;stand how or why it works, but the re&shy;so&shy;lu&shy;tion it provides, both in Chris&rsquo; original and in my va&shy;ri&shy;a&shy;tion, is off the charts &ndash; which is es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly re&shy;mar&shy;kab&shy;le be&shy;cause, un&shy;til it hits, nei&shy;ther piece even feels like it&rsquo;s been buil&shy;ding ten&shy;sion.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This tran&shy;si&shy;tion is jar&shy;ring, and I&rsquo;m not ev&shy;en sure I want to fix it. In fact, I&rsquo;m fair&shy;ly sure I don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s a ma&shy;jor e&shy;mo&shy;tion&shy;al shift be&shy;tween these two move&shy;ments, and I think it&rsquo;s even more ef&shy;fec&shy;tive if it&rsquo;s sud&shy;den.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;d intended this move&shy;ment to mash up mul&shy;ti&shy;ple <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain</em> songs, and it does. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to fur&shy;ther <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> stems (i.e., the vocals), I worked in some stems from <a href="https://youtu.be/VTJcLE_VVX8" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</a> that, after I pitch-shif&shy;ted them from D mi&shy;nor to C mi&shy;nor and slowed it from 100 to 88 bpm, dove&shy;tailed beau&shy;ti&shy;ful&shy;ly with the for&shy;mer song&rsquo;s syn&shy;the&shy;si&shy;zer so&shy;lo, <span id="ftnt_ref07" class="dotted" title="Translator&rsquo;s note: &lsquo;keikaku&rsquo; means &lsquo;plan&rsquo;.  &para;  (In case you were curious, &ldquo;keikaku d&omacr;ri&rdquo;, the source of the memetic &ldquo;just as planned&rdquo;, is written in kanji as &#x300C;計画 通り&#x300D; or &#x300C;計劃 通り&#x300D; and in hiragana as &#x300C;けいかく どおり&#x300D;.)">just according to <em>keikaku</em><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt07" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8311;&#8318;</a>.</span> (<span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> is ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly 110 bpm, but it&rsquo;s also 5/4, while <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is 4/4; thus, lin&shy;ing the meas&shy;ures up re&shy;qui&shy;res mak&shy;ing the lat&shy;ter&rsquo;s tem&shy;po 80% of the for&shy;mer&rsquo;s.)</p>

				<p class="fixheight">But while I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted the two songs to work to&shy;geth&shy;er, I was ab&shy;so&shy;lute&shy;ly flab&shy;ber&shy;gas&shy;ted at <em>how well</em> they worked to&shy;ge&shy;ther. I&rsquo;d ex&shy;pec&shy;ted to have to fi&shy;nag&shy;le the har&shy;mo&shy;ny of the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> segments at least a lit&shy;tle bit, but my in&shy;stincts had been dead-on: ev&shy;e&shy;ry&shy;thing fit to&shy;ge&shy;ther per&shy;fect&shy;ly as soon as I lined it up. It&rsquo;s not that the chord pro&shy;gres&shy;sions are i&shy;den&shy;ti&shy;cal &ndash; far from it, in fact. The me&shy;lo&shy;dy of Chris&rsquo; solo in the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Rain&shy;drop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo;</span> simp&shy;ly hap&shy;pens to work per&shy;fect&shy;ly over the chords from the back half of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>.</p>
				
				<p class="fixheight">I still plan to throw in el&shy;e&shy;ments of a few of Chris&rsquo; oth&shy;er songs, if I can find pla&shy;ces to fit them in. Most likely, I&rsquo;ll at least at&shy;tempt to work in el&shy;e&shy;ments of <a href="https://youtu.be/LEUwTBWkeas" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">&ldquo;Mois&shy;ture De&shy;fi&shy;cit&rdquo;</a> (which <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span> is a re&shy;make of) and <a href="https://youtu.be/81QhAo3hLrM" target="_blank" class="weight3 underline songlink">&ldquo;Once in a Lul&shy;la&shy;by&rdquo;</a>, or id&shy;eal&shy;ly both.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This ti&shy;tle (again, if I haven&rsquo;t made any er&shy;rors) means <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;You Dream of Vi&shy;ol&shy;ent Growth&rdquo;</span> (ro&shy;man&shy;ized: <em class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;Ho&shy;ne&shy;i&shy;ro&shy;po&shy;l&eacute;e&shy;is t&ecirc;s bi&shy;a&iacute;&shy;&amacr;s aux&shy;&iacute;&shy;se&shy;os&rdquo;</em>), the phrase <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Risk of Rain 2</em> dis&shy;plays if you use the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Lu&shy;nar Seer</span> to force <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Sun&shy;dered Grove</span> (the stage that plays <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;</span>) to spawn as the next stage.</p>

				<p class="fixheight">This won&rsquo;t be the fi&shy;nal track in this col&shy;lec&shy;tion when it&rsquo;s fin&shy;ished &ndash; I&rsquo;m not done wri&shy;ting songs for it yet.</p>

				<blockquote>I didn&rsquo;t know the intro was in 11/4 time. I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with: it was like 1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2,3&ndash;1,2; I didn&rsquo;t count it as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. It was one beat short, but it didn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> one short, because to get back to the triad, you had two steps to go up. You&rsquo;d really hit those two hard, to accent them, so that would separate the threes. &hellip; [Gregg&rsquo;s brother Duane] said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, man; I didn&rsquo;t know that you understood 11/4.&rdquo; Of course, I said something intelligent like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s 11/4?&rdquo; Duane just said, &ldquo;Okay, dumbass, I&rsquo;ll try to draw it up on paper for you.&rdquo;</blockquote>
			
				(Note that while notating the intro as 11/4 isn&rsquo;t strictly <em>wrong</em>, its triplets are really more characteristic of 11/8. Notating it as (3+3+3+2)/8, as Gregg was effectively doing in the first place, is also acceptable.)
