			<!--<p>I gave this page the most deliberately provocative title I could, but it is my sincere advice. The title contains an unspoken second half, which I believe the laws of tension and release legally require me to reveal at the end, but if you keep reading, you&rsquo;ll have figured it out long before then.</p>-->

			<blockquote style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><em>(Those lacking context for this are advised to start with my <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="mapmaking101.html">beginners&rsquo; guide to <span style="font-style: normal;">Marathon</span> mapmaking</a>.)</em></blockquote>

			<!--<p>By way of introduction, if you don&rsquo;t know <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="index.html">me</a>, I&rsquo;ve been involved in my share of scenario development projects over the years. One (<em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://eternal.bungie.org/" target="_blank">Eternal</a></em>) saw a major update released in late 2021 (another is still pending), one of them (<em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5/" target="_blank">Apotheosis X</a></em>) saw its 1.0 release in 2022 and its 1.1 release in 2023; and a third that has been in the works for some five years (<em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>) may <em>finally</em> get its 1.0 release out the door late this year. And that&rsquo;s just for starters; the full list is <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="portfolio.html">much, much longer</a>, of which only a small portion is actually finished.</p>

			<p>I mention this not because I think any of that innately invites respect (it doesn&rsquo;t), but as a way to indicate that I&rsquo;ve seen things you people wouldn&rsquo;t believe. Attack ships on fire off&hellip; no, that&rsquo;s <em>Blade Runner</em>, sorry. But I want it to be clear that I&rsquo;m not writing this to belittle anyone&rsquo;s ideas or disparage their efforts. I&rsquo;m writing it in the spirit of realism. I&rsquo;ve seen, firsthand, how scenarios get made &ndash; and, vastly more often, <em>don&rsquo;t</em>.</p>-->

			<p>I know this <em>really</em> isn&rsquo;t what you want to hear, but: <strong class="toc-counter">Don&rsquo;t make a scenario by yourself. Don&rsquo;t even try.</strong> Don&rsquo;t even entertain the thought. No, I see you entertaining it right now. Stop that. Stop it right now. Start small, learn the basics, make a few single-level single-player maps, get some player feedback, and then &ndash; and this part is really important &ndash; <em>join an existing project when you&rsquo;ve proved you know what you&rsquo;re doing</em>.</p>

			<p>All of us have ideas we think are the Coolest Ideas Ever when we start out mapping. The problem is, so does everyone else that starts out mapping, and maybe 1% of those ideas ever actually turn into finished scenarios. Why? Because making a scenario is extraordinarily hard, extraordinarily time-consuming, and requires a depth and breadth of skills and time far beyond most single individuals&rsquo; capabilities. (Remember <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter's_Law">Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law</a>: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&rsquo;s Law.)</p>

			<p>As a result, most of those Coolest Ideas Ever will never exist in playable form unless enough capable people join forces and pool their efforts. This inevitably means that some of your ideas will change in the making, because they won&rsquo;t fit together perfectly with others&rsquo; ideas. But &ndash; and this part may not be easy to hear either &ndash; <strong class="toc-counter">this will improve them,</strong> since subjecting an idea to varied perspectives strengthens it. The interchange tests ideas for weaknesses, uncovers them, and finds ways to eliminate them &ndash; in short, it makes those ideas <em>better</em>.</p>

			<p>To cover several well-known examples, in roughly ascending order of team size:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>hypersleep worked on most aspects of <em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5/" target="_blank">Apotheosis X</a></em> in some capacity or another, but I think the music was the only thing he did entirely himself. Another three people worked on maps, one worked on animation, two contributed writing and plot ideas, and one worked on Lua scripting and some of the sound effects.</li>
				<li><em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://marathonrubicon.com/" target="_blank">Rubicon X</a></em> was at least seven people&rsquo;s work (five mappers, three artists, a composer).</li>
				<li>RyokoTK made most of <em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-phoenix-2/" target="_blank">Phoenix</a></em>&rsquo;s levels, but Goran Svensson contributed a few; counting Ryoko, six people contributed graphics, and the music was two other people&rsquo;s work (three, if you count remastering).</li>
				<li><em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://hhas01.itch.io/trojan-se" target="_blank">Trojan</a></em>&rsquo;s music alone is four different people&rsquo;s work, and I count at least eight credited mappers. Two people worked on sounds across various releases, and I didn&rsquo;t even try counting all the artists.</li>
				<li>On the higher end of the spectrum, <em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="http://nardo.bungie.org/alephone.php" target="_blank">Tempus Irae</a></em> and its sequel <em>Tempus Irae II: The Lost Levels</em> have between them fourteen credited mappers and nineteen total credited contributors. (<em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> will bump those numbers to fifteen and at least thirty, respectively.)
				<li><em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://eternal.bungie.org/" target="_blank">Eternal X</a></em>, at what I&rsquo;m pretty sure is the high end, has forty-four credited contributors.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>There&rsquo;s a reason for this: however much work you think it is to make a scenario, it&rsquo;s probably well over ten times more work than that. Having people to:</p>
				<ol class="loweralpha">
					<li>bounce ideas off of,</li>
					<li>keep you focused,</li>
					<li>remind you of your scope,</li>
					<li>provide critiques</li>
				</ol>
			<p>will make you work harder, better, faster, and smarter. (OK, fine, <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQ" target="_blank">stronger</a>, too.) </p>

			<p>For the sake of completeness, two obvious outliers bear mention here:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://lochnits.com/marathon/istoria" target="_blank">Istoria</a></em> is mostly three people&rsquo;s work &ndash; and it&rsquo;s also only ten levels long. (This is actually a superb example of keeping your scope realistic for your team&rsquo;s size.)</li>
					<li><em><a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://citadel.lhowon.org/scenarios/marathon-red/" target="_blank">Red</a></em> (original website <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="http://bighouse.bungie.org/red/" target="_blank">here</a>) is entirely the work of one guy, who went on to become a professional <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/606484/ian-mcconville/" target="_blank">game</a> and <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://www.machall.com/#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">webcomic</a> <a class="underlinelink weight3" href="https://www.threepanelsoul.com/" target="_blank">artist</a>. He also made it in a single year as a teenager and now seems to be embarrassed by it. There&rsquo;s an exception to every rule. But in this case, probably only one.</li>
				</ol>

			<p>If everyone that came to Reddit or Discord to ask, &ldquo;How do I make a scenario?&rdquo; pooled their efforts, they might, <em>collectively, between them,</em> come up with a scenario &ndash; which would be one more than we have right now.</p>

			<p>And just to make certain I&rsquo;ve been absolutely clear: I&rsquo;m not telling anyone not to start <em>mapping</em>. But <strong class="toc-counter">before trying to fly, learn to crawl &ndash; and once you&rsquo;ve mastered walking and driving, <em>join a flight school</em>.</strong></p>
