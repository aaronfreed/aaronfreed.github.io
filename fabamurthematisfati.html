	<h2 class="centred petitecaps balanced-wrap" style="line-height: initial;">(&ldquo;We Were Speaking of Fate&rdquo;, or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Latin)</h2>

<p>On <span title="March 27, 2020, in the objectively correct date format (ISO 8601)" style="text-decoration: 1px dotted underline; text-underline-offset: 3px;">2020-03-27</span>, I translated <em class="accent weight3">Where Monsters Are in Dreams</em>&rsquo; level name <span class="accent weight3">&ldquo;We Were Speaking of Fate&rdquo;</span> to Latin as <span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;F&amacr;b&amacr;mur thematis f&amacr;t&imacr;&rdquo;</span>. This is actually wordy: its most obvious literal translation is <span class="toc-counter weight1">&ldquo;we were speaking of the theme of fate&rdquo;</span>. <span class="toc-counter weight1">“F&amacr;b&amacr;mur f&amacr;t&imacr;”</span> would be more precise and concise, so why didn&rsquo;t I use that? Two reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li><em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thema#Latin" target="_blank">Thema</a></em>, whence <em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thematis#Latin" target="_blank">thematis</a></em>, has an alternate meaning: <em class="toc-counter weight1">the alignment of celestial bodies at a person&rsquo;s birth, horoscope</em> (per Wiktionary, whither all links on this page go, apart from the footer). So, metonymically, also <em class="toc-counter weight1">fate</em>. (I don&rsquo;t believe in astrology, but I set that aside for the sake of poetic license.)</li>
	<li><em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fabamur#Latin" target="_blank">F&amacr;b&amacr;mur</a></em> is the active imperfect indicative first-person plural form of the verb <em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fatum#Latin" target="_blank">for</a></em>, or <em class="toc-counter weight1">I speak</em>. As if by fate, <em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fatum#Latin" target="_blank">f&amacr;tum</a></em> (<em class="toc-counter weight1">destiny</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">fate</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">lot</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">death</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">speech of a god</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">utterance</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">declaration</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">proclamation</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">prediction</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">prophecy</em>), whence <em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fati#Latin" target="_blank">f&amacr;t&imacr;</a></em>, is the neuter form of <em class="accent weight3" lang=la>for</em>&rsquo;s perfect active participle, <em class="weight3 underlinelink" lang="la"><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fatus#Latin" target="_blank">f&amacr;tus</a></em>; thus, it also means <em class="toc-counter weight1">spoken</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">said</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">told</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">foretold</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">related</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight1">predicted</em>, or <em class="toc-counter weight1">having or had spoken</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Putting this all together, <span class="accent weight3" lang="la">&ldquo;F&amacr;b&amacr;mur thematis f&amacr;t&imacr;&rdquo;</span> can also mean <span class="toc-counter weight1">&ldquo;we were speaking of the fate of the foretold&rdquo;</span>, <span class="toc-counter weight1">&ldquo;we were speaking of the fate of the spoken&rdquo;</span>, and so on. It also effectively packs two puns or double entendres into three words. I found this absolutely wild (in reaction to this, I wrote &ldquo;Latin is <em>amazing</em>&rdquo; on Discord), and it turned Latin from a casual interest into an obsession.</p>
