<h2 class="centred" id="normanconquest">The Norman Conquest, or How English Became English</h2>

This is the opening of <em>Beowulf</em>, the most famous work in what we now call Anglo-Saxon or Old English.

<p>A few words of this are recognizable as what we now call English (“under”, “wæs”, “æfter”, “in”, “God”, “sende”, “sprang”). However, in every meaningful sense, this is a foreign language. It might as well be Old Norse; in fact, the two languages have much greater similarities than Old English does to Modern English.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to translate this; my complete knowledge of Anglo-Saxon extends to knowing that “<span lang="ang">Wyrd bið ful aræd</span>” can be translated in several ways, including “fate is wholly inexorable”, “fate is law”… and “the way of the world is ever an open book”. (See <a href="https://oldenglishpoetry.camden.rutgers.edu/2017/06/08/wyrd-bid-ful-araed-the-wanderer-line-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this fascinating analysis</a> from Rutgers professor Ophelia Eryn Hostetter.)</p>

<p>By contrast, Geoffrey Chaucer&rsquo;s <em>The Canterbury Tales</em>, the most famous literary work in Middle English, opens:</p>

<p><em>This</em> is English. It&rsquo;s English with a funny accent, and a few words that are now lost or forgotten, but anyone that can read English out loud can do so with this passage and parse most of its meaning.</p>

<p>What happened? Well, <em>Beowulf</em> was first conceived sometime between 700 and 1000 CE, and first written down sometime from 975 to 1025 CE. Geoffrey Chaucer began <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> in 1387 and continued writing it until his death at 1400 (unfortunately, he left it in an incomplete state). Linguistically, the most important event to English’s linguistic development occurred in 1066: William the Conqueror earned the title by which history now knows him. In other words, after the Norman Conquest, English started to turn French.</p>

<p>One could even argue what we now know as &ldquo;English&rdquo; is a language that diverged from its parent, and that at some point during this timeframe, the name &ldquo;English&rdquo; was applied to a completely new language.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, I want to emphasize this point: English changed vastly more between 1066 CE and 1400 CE than it has changed between 1400 CE and the present. There is an order of magnitude more difference between the language of <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> than there is between that of <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> and, say, Cormac McCarthy’s <em>No Country for Old Men</em> (2005). This leads to my titular hot take on the English language.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="grecoromaninfluence">Greco-Roman Influence on English</h2>

<p>English is usually classified as a Germanic language. Broadly, this is true in that most of our <em>short</em> words are Germanic. The more syllables an English word contains, however, the higher the odds that it comes to us from either Latin or Greek (if not both). Let&rsquo;s examine some of the words I&rsquo;ve already written, starting with <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/word#Etymology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">word</a></em>. (All etymologies are from Wiktionary, one of the Internet&rsquo;s most underrated resources for learning languages.)</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Dutch <em lang="dut">worden</em>, from Middle Dutch <em lang="dum">werden</em>, from Old Dutch <em lang="dum">werthan</em>, from Proto-Germanic <em lang="gem">*werþaną</em>.</blockquote>

(The asterisk before <em lang="gem">*werþaną</em> is a linguistic convention signifying a modern linguistic reconstruction of which no attested examples survive. I’ll omit some of these for brevity, as this is already quite a long piece.)<p>

<p>So chalk up one for Germanic. Let&rsquo;s look at <em>here</em>, the first word I used in this text.</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em lang="enm">her</em>, from Old English <em lang="ang">hēr</em> (“at this place”), from Proto-West Germanic <em lang="gem">*hēr</em></blockquote>

<p>Another short Germanic word. What about <em>text</em>?</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em lang="enm">text</em>, from Old French <em lang="fro">texte</em> (“text”), from Medieval Latin <em lang="la">textus</em> (“the Scriptures, text, treatise”), from Latin <em lang="la">textus</em> (“style or texture of a work”), perfect passive participle of <em lang="la">texō</em> (“I weave”). Cognate to English <em>texture</em>.</blockquote>

<p>So, even some of our short words are Latin. What about our longer ones? Let&rsquo;s start with <em>linguistic</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">Borrowed from German <em lang="ger">linguistisch</em>, equivalent to <em>linguist</em> + <em>-ic</em>.[1] Compare <em>linguistics</em>. Ultimately from Latin <em lang="la">lingua</em> (“tongue, language”). Attested in English since 1825.</blockquote>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a three-syllable Latin word. This etymology also covers <em>language</em>, in fact:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em lang="enm">langage</em>, <em lang="enm">language</em>, from Old French <em lang="fro">language</em>, from Vulgar Latin <em lang="la">*linguāticum</em>, from Latin <em lang="la">lingua</em> (“tongue, speech, language”), from Old Latin <em lang="la">dingua</em> (“tongue”), from Proto-Indo-European <em>*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s</em> (“tongue, speech, language”). Doublet of <em>langaj</em>. Displaced native Old English <em lang="ang">ġeþēode</em>.</blockquote>

<p>And <em>syllable</em>?</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em lang="enm">syllable</em>, <em lang="enm">sillable</em>, <em lang="enm">syllabylle</em>, <em lang="enm">sylabul</em>, from Anglo-Norman <em lang="ang">sillable</em>, from Old French <em lang="gro">sillebe</em>, from Latin <em lang="la">syllaba</em>, from Ancient Greek <em lang="grc">συλλαβή</em> (<em lang="grc">sullabe&#772;&#769;</em>), from <em lang="grc">συλλαμβάνω</em> (<em lang="grc">sullambánō</em>, “I gather together”), from <em lang="grc">συν-</em> (<em lang="grc">sun-</em>, “together”) + <em lang="grc">λαμβάνω</em> (<em lang="grc">lambánō</em>, “I take”).</blockquote>

<p>In short, <em>syllable</em> is <em>both</em> Latin and Greek. And whence <em>etymology</em>?

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em lang="enm">ethymologie</em>, from Old French <em lang="gro">ethimologie</em>, from Latin <em lang="la">etymologia</em>, from Ancient Greek <em lang="grc">ἐτυμολογία</em> (<em lang="grc">etumología</em>), from <em lang="grc">ἔτυμον</em> (<em lang="grc">étumon</em>, “true sense”) and <em lang="grc">-λογία</em> (<em lang="grc">-logía</em>, “study or logic of”), from <em lang="grc">λόγος</em> (<em lang="grc">lógos</em>, “word; explanation”).</blockquote>

<em>Thesis</em> is also a Greek word (<em lang="grc">θέσῐς</em>, <em lang="grc">thésĭs</em>), as are its derivatives <em>hypothesis</em> (<em lang="grc">ὑπόθεσις</em>, <em lang="grc">hupóthesis</em>), <em>antithesis</em> (<em lang="grc">ἀντίθεσις</em>, <em lang="grc">antíthesis</em>), <em>synthesis</em> (<em lang="grc">σύνθεσις</em>, <em lang="grc">súnthesis</em>), and <em>prosthesis</em> (<em lang="grc">πρόσθεσις</em>, <em lang="grc">prósthesis</em>).  

<p>And I could go on, but I believe I&rsquo;ve made my point: Latin and Greek words are ubiquitous in English. (<em>Ubiquitous</em> is also Latin, incidentally: it is derived from <em>ubiquē</em>, literally <em>wherever</em> but used to mean <em>everywhere</em>.) Classifying English as Germanic is a severe oversimplification; it is actually a bastardized Germanic-Romance language (fitting, since romance can result in bastards if its participants are careless). I might even classify it as a Germanic-Romance-Hellenic language if that weren’t too much of a mouthful.</p>

<p>I haven’t been deliberately choosing Greek and Latin words to use as examples, but I acknowledge that my study of those languages may subconsciously influence me to use them.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="allgreek">Greek is <em>not</em> all Greek to you (you know more than you think)</h2>

<p>So enough about that pet peeve. Let’s address another one: the idiom “It’s all Greek to me.” Not even Greek is all Greek to you: as I’ve already shown, you already know some Greek; you probably just don’t <em>know</em> you know it. You may not know <em>the Greek alphabet</em>, but it’s really not very difficult to learn. It only has 24 letters, and you already know a lot of them. The letters that will most defy your intuition are likely:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Gamma</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Γ / γ)</strong> is a hard <em>g</em> in Ancient Greek. In Modern Greek, most of the time, it&rsquo;s somewhere between <em>g</em> and <em>zh</em>, but before certain vowels, it&rsquo;s basically a <em>y</em>. 
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Nu</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Ν / ν)</strong> is <em>n</em>.</li>
 	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Eta</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Η / η)</strong> is somewhere between <em>i</em> and <em>e</em>.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Rho</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Ρ / ρ)</strong> is <em>r</em>.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Omega</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Ω / ω)</strong> is a long <em>o</em>.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Chi</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Χ / χ)</strong> is <em>k</em> in Ancient Greek; in modern Greek, it&rsquo;s closer to either German and Scottish <em>ch</em> or to English <em>h</em>, depending on its placement.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Upsilon</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">(Υ / υ)</strong> was originally closer to the English <em>ooh</em> (and thus the Latin <em>u</em>), but in Classical Greek, it started to resemble the German <em>ü</em>, and in Modern Greek, it resembles our long <em>e</em>.</li>
</ul>

However, as a beginning reader of Greek, you&rsquo;ll already have a good intuition of what almost half the letters you encounter read represent:
<ul>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Uppercase:</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">Α</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Β</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ε</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ζ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ι</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Κ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Μ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ν</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ο</strong>, and <strong class="toc-counter">Τ</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Lowercase:</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">α</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">β</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">δ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ε</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ι</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">κ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ο</strong>, and <strong class="toc-counter">τ</strong>.</li>
</ul>

Thus, you&rsquo;ll only need to learn:
<ul>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Uppercase:</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">Γ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Δ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Η</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Θ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Λ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ξ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Π</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ρ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Σ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Υ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Φ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Χ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">Ψ</strong>, and <strong class="toc-counter">Ω</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong class="accent weight3">Lowercase:</strong> <strong class="toc-counter">γ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ζ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">η</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">θ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">λ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">μ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ν</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ξ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">π</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">σ</strong>/<strong class="toc-counter">ς</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">υ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">φ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">χ</strong>, <strong class="toc-counter">ψ</strong>, and <strong class="toc-counter">ω</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s fourteen uppercase and <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref01" title="OK, sixteen if you count sigma’s two forms separately.">fifteen lowercase letters<a href="#ftnt01" class="noprintlink">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>. You can knock that out tonight. I believe in you.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the idiom “It’s all Greek to me” should use a different language that’s had a lot less influence on English. I vote <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref02" title="I refuse to call Chinese a single language &ndash; it is only classified as such for political reasons, namely that the Chinese government insists on it. Spoken Mandarin and spoken Cantonese are not mutually comprehensible enough to qualify as a single language &ndash; spoken Italian and spoken Spanish are more mutually comprehensible than spoken Mandarin and spoken Cantonese are, to the extent that Italians and Spaniards frequently communicate in their native languages in business meetings and have no trouble understanding each other. Spoken Mandarin and spoken Cantonese are not so similar. ¶ Mind you, *written* Chinese *is* a single language. It just isn’t the same language as *spoken* Mandarin or *spoken* Cantonese. Again, I suspect there are political reasons for this.">Mandarin<a href="#ftnt02" class="noprintlink">&#8317;&sup2;&#8318;</a></span> &ndash; it&rsquo;s the world’s most widely spoken language, and most English speakers know almost none of it, either written or spoken.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="knowledge">A little knowledge is a dangerous thing</h2>

<p>But let&rsquo;s ignore the alphabet. Let&rsquo;s return to etymologies, starting with… ok, fine, let’s <em>not</em> ignore <em>alphabet</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From Middle English <em>alphabete</em>, borrowed from Classical Latin <em>alphabētum</em>, from Ancient Greek <em>ἀλφάβητος</em> (<em>alphábētos</em>), from <em>ἄλφα</em> (<em>álpha</em>) and <em>βῆτα</em> (<em>bêta</em>), the names of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, Α (A) and Β (B), lowercase forms α and β. The Greek names derived from <em>aleph</em>, the name of the Phoenician letter 𐤀 (ʾ, “ox”) and <em>beth</em>, the name of the letter 𐤁 (b, “house”), so called because they were pictograms of those objects, having developed from the Egyptian hieroglyphs 𓃾 and 𓉐.</blockquote>

So, it’s basically Greek. What about <em>ignore</em>?

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">From French <em>ignorer</em>, from Latin <em>ignōrō</em> (“to have no knowledge of, mistake, take no notice of, ignore”), from <em>ignārus</em> (“not knowing”), from <em>in</em> + <em>gnārus</em> (“knowing”), from <em>gnōscō</em>, <em>nōscō</em>; see <em>know</em>.</blockquote>

Apparently Latin. Surely <em>agnostic</em> is also Latin, then?

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">Coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1870. Either from Ancient Greek <em>ἄγνωστος</em> (<em>ágnōstos</em>, “ignorant, not knowing”), or from <em>a-</em> + <em>Gnostic</em>, deriving (either way) from Ancient Greek <em>ἀ-</em> (<em>a-</em>, “not”) + <em>γιγνώσκω</em> (<em>gignṓskō</em>, “I know”). </blockquote>

So no, it&rsquo;s Greek. Which <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref03" title="I likewise refuse to use the phrase “begs the question” this way. I know we’ve already lost the battle against this usage, just as we’ve lost the battle against “literally” meaning “figuratively”, but dammit, I have *principles*.">raises the question<a href="#ftnt03" class="noprintlink">&#8317;&sup3;&#8318;</a></span>: are <em>gnōscō</em> and <em>γιγνώσκω</em> cognates?

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">Cognates [of <em>γιγνώσκω</em>] include English <em>know</em>, Latin <em>gnōscō</em>, Albanian <em>njoh</em>, Old Armenian <em>ճան-</em> (<em>čan-</em>, “to know”), Sanskrit <em>जानाति</em> (<em>jānāti</em>, “to know”), and Old Persian 𐎧𐏁𐎴𐎿𐏃𐎡𐎹 (<em>x-š-n-s-h-i-y</em> />⁠xšnāsāhiy⁠/, “you shall know”).</em></blockquote>

So, yes and <em>know</em>. (Sorry, I’m constitutionally incapable of resisting a pun like that.)

<h2 class="centred" id="adamkneweve">“And Adam knew Eve his wife…”</h2>

I only learned that <em>know</em> is cognate to <em>gnōscō</em> and <em>γιγνώσκω</em> while writing this essay. This answered a linguistic curiosity I’d had for years: why all three are euphemisms for <em>have sex with</em> or <em>have ever had sex with</em>. Let’s examine one of the most famous uses of this meaning, Genesis 4:1 (KJV, of course):

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the <span class="petitecaps">Lord</span>.</blockquote>

In the Vulgate, Saint Jerome’s Latin translation from 382&mdash;405 CE, this passage is:

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">Ādām vero cognōvit Havam uxōrem suam quae concēpit et peperit Cain dīcēns possēdī hominem per Dominum.</blockquote>

<p>(<em>Cognovit</em> is a form of <em>cognōscō</em>, a derivative of <em>gnōscō</em>).</p>

<p>And here it is in the Septuagint, the Koine Greek translation (ca. 3rd century BCE):</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">ΑΔΑΜ δὲ ἔγνω Εὔαν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκε τὸν Κάϊν καὶ εἶπεν, ἐκτησάμην ἄνθρωπον διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ.</blockquote>

<p>Here, <em>ἔγνω</em> is the third-person singular aorist active indicative of <em>γιγνώσκω</em>. In short, <em>knew</em> isn&rsquo;t a whim of King James’ translators; it’s an exact translation of the Vulgate and the Septuagint.

<p>Now, let’s <del>immanentize the Eschaton</del> romanize the Septuagint.</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter norightmargin">ADAM dé égnō Eúān te&#772;&#769;n gŭnaîkă autoû, kaì sullaboûsa éteke tòn Káïn kaì eîpen, ektēsámēn ánthrōpon dià toû Theoû.</blockquote>

<p>You already know many of those words. <em>Autoû</em> is a form of <em>αὐτός</em> (<em>autós</em>), meaning <em>self</em>. This is its masucline genitive singular form, which indicates possession; thus, <em>τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ</em> (<em>te&#772;&#769;n gŭnaîkă autoû</em>) means <em>his own wife</em>.</p>

<p><em>&Alpha;ὐτός</em> is the source of the English prefix <em>auto-</em>. <em>Automobile</em>, one of its most common uses, is a bastard hybrid of Greek and Latin, which is an abomination unto Nuggan. Possible fixes (that will never actually happen) include:
	<ul>
		<li><em>autokinetis</em>, from <em>αὐτο-</em> (<em>auto-</em>, “self-”) + <em>κῑνέω</em> (kīnéō, “I move”) + <em>-τής</em> (<em>-te&#772;&#769;s</em>, “-er, -or”)</li>
		<li><em>ipsimobile</em>, from <em>ipsi-</em> (&ldquo;self-&rdquo;) + <em>mobilis</em> (&ldquo;mobile, movable&rdquo;)</li>
	</ul>
<p>(Now get off my lawn.)</p>
	
<p class="marginbottom15">More seriously, by translating from Greek and Latin, we see that <em>automobile</em> literally means <em>self-movable</em>.</p>

<p class="margintop15 marginbottom15">Next up, <em>sullaboûsa</em> looks a lot like <em>syllable</em>, doesn’t it? Well, as seen above, <em>syllable</em> is derived from <em>συλλαμβάνω</em> (<em>sullambánō</em>, &ldquo;I gather together&rdquo;). As it turns out, <em>συλλαβοῦσα</em> is the aorist participle of <em>συλλαμβάνω</em>. So chalk up another word you’ve encountered before. However, this is a different use that hasn’t transferred to English; the phrase <em>συλλαμβάνω ἔτεκε</em> (<em>sullaboûsa éteke</em>) actually means <em>conceived and gave birth to</em>.</p>

<p class="margintop15">Of course, <em>ánthrōpon</em> is the accusative singular of <em>ἄνθρωπος</em> (<em>ắnthrōpos</em>, “human being”). You probably already had a sense of what this means because it&rsquo;s the source of numerous English words, including:</p>
<ul class="marginbottom15">
	<li><em class="accent weight3">anthropic</em>:
		<ul>
			<li><em class="toc-counter weight2">ἄνθρωπος</em></li>

<p class="margintop15">Lastly, <em>Θεοῦ</em> (<em>Theoû</em>) is clearly <em>God</em>. Where else would we have gotten <em>theology</em>, <em>theocracy</em>, <em>atheism</em>, <em>pantheism</em>, <em>monotheism</em>, and <em>polytheism</em>? (I leave parsing these words’ etymologies as an exercise for the reader: I believe you are now capable of doing so yourself, and the exercise will benefit anyone with sufficient interest in etymology to have read this far.)</p>

<p>One lesson I hope you&rsquo;ve drawn from this is a major reason I love studying Latin and Greek: not only do they give us an idea of where so many of our words came from, but they enable us to know the meanings of words we’ve never seen before. If I’ve never seen the word <em>bibliophilia</em>, but I know <em>βιβλίον</em> (<em>biblíon</em>) means <em>book</em> and <em>φῐλῐ́ᾱ</em> (<em>phĭli&#774;&#769;ā</em>) means <em>love</em>, then I immediately know <em>bibliophilia</em> means <em>love of books</em> without having to look it up. I find that immensely satisfying.</p>

<p>If you’re counting, nearly all words with at least three syllables have been Latin or Greek. One-syllable words are mostly Germanic; two-syllable words go about fifty-fifty.</p>
