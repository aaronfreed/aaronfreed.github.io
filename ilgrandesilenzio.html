		<p><em>(Map forthcoming.)</em></p>

		<p>This is a very nonlinear level. You have three keys to pick up, three keyholes to put them into, and three switches to activate underwater before the path to the exit opens up. Apart from that, you can complete its objectives in more or less any order. Its combat is equally nonlinear: if you want to activate enemies one segment at a time, you can do that; if you want to go all Leeroy Jenkins, activate as many enemies as possible, and induce as much infighting as possible, you can do that, too. I designed this level to make the latter relatively feasible (especially in the outdoor areas), though its hazards are numerous enough to merit their own section.</p>

		<p>The three keys are marked on the map at points K1, K2, and K3. (This level is just about as treacherous as K2&hellip; never mind.) The keyholes they activate are marked at points KH1, KH2, and KH3, though you can insert any key in any switch. (It took every bit of my self-restraint not to make an equally terrible <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> pun here&hellip; wait. Shit.) After you&rsquo;ve inserted one key, you&rsquo;ll be able to get into the house behind it. Inserting two will open the passage between the two houses you&rsquo;ve opened; inserting all three will open the remaining two passages between houses and make it possible to enter the waterfalls found in all three passages.</p>

		<p>Enter any of these waterfalls and sink to the bottom. You&rsquo;ll find another triangle at a slightly lower level, exactly 180&deg; out of phase with the upper triangle. There are three switches on the inside of the inner triangle, exactly bisecting its corners. (OK fine, they&rsquo;re actually both lopsided hexagons.) Activating all three of them will raise three pillars back at ground level (P1, P2, and P3); in addition, it opens the door to the house that contains the exit (D). Go back to the path that takes you to the southeastern house, and this time, jump across the pillars. Deal with the last monsters, and leave whenever you&rsquo;re ready. (It might be worth making sure you&rsquo;re not leaving large quantities of ammo or health behind first, though.)</p>

		<h2 class="centred" id="combat">Combat &amp; Other Hazards</h2>

		<p>First of all, watch your step on this one. Don&rsquo;t jump anywhere unless you&rsquo;re sure you have a path back &ndash; if you fall too far, you&rsquo;ll die. The converse of this is also true for all monsters except Juggernauts and Drones, though, which you can use to your advantage by knocking many of them off cliffs.</p>

		<p>On that note, most of this level&rsquo;s monsters have major physics changes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Gray Juggernauts&rsquo; alien weapon bolts are faster than the vanilla bolts; their rockets are extremely dangerous and will one-shot you if you are below vanilla health.</li>
			<li>Mothers of All Cyborgs now fire either a stream of non-bouncing grenades or the same kind of rockets that Juggernauts fire. To balance this out, they go berserk and start attacking all monsters near them when they are close to death. They&rsquo;ve also been divided into Major and Minor ranks, although you will only see Minors on Normal and below; on Major Damage, half will be Major and half will be Minor, and on Total Carnage, all will be Major. They&rsquo;re also immune to knockback due to an engine bug that occurred when they weren&rsquo;t.</li>
			<li>Mothers of All Hunters now fire large streams of bolts. Any individual bolt is somewhat less powerful than a vanilla Hunter bolt, but they fire vastly larger numbers of them at vastly increased paces (in much the same manner as the &ldquo;Polygonum opus&rdquo; boss hunter). These have been divided into Major and Minor ranks the same way Mothers of All Cyborgs have; they also will go berserk when close to death.</li>
			<li>Red and Yellow Enforcers have much faster bolts than vanilla Enforcers do. The normal Major and Minor ranks are still present on the level, and their bolts maintain their vanilla speed.</li>
			<li>Fighters attack faster and more aggressively on this level. In <em>Marathon 1</em>, Fighters&rsquo; attack animation lasts twelve ticks (0.4 s), or three ticks (0.1 s) per frame. <em>Marathon 2</em> and <em>Infinity</em> slowed this down to sixteen ticks (0.53333&hellip; s), or four ticks (0.13333&hellip; s) per frame. Throughout most of <em>Tempus Irae</em>, their attack animation matches its <em>M2</em> speed, but on this level, I restored their attack animation to its <em>M1</em> speed. Additionally, all Fighters have far shorter delays between attacks, and each type has an additional change beyond that:
				<ul>
					<li>Projectile Fighter bolts travel 37.5% faster than their vanilla counterparts.</li>
					<li>Melee Fighters move roughly 50% faster than their vanilla counterparts.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>There are two new variants of drones on this level:
				<ul>
					<li>The first fires S&rsquo;pht&rsquo;Kr style bolts that each pack quite a wallop, though they don&rsquo;t fire very many of them or fire them very often.</li>
					<li>The other fires a stream of vanilla-style drone bolts that don&rsquo;t <em>individually</em> pack much of a punch, but they fire enough of them that getting struck by an entire swarm will seriously damage your health.</li>
				</ul>
			In addition, and perhaps more dangerously, they&rsquo;re immune to each other&rsquo;s attacks, so you can&rsquo;t just circle-strafe a swarm of drones to whittle down their numbers. (They&rsquo;re still vulnerable to Pfhor attacks, though.)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Furthermore, any time you see a large, non-secret cache of ammo, you can be almost certain that picking it up (or even stepping onto the polygon that contains it) will cause a large welcoming party to teleport in. (This is the sort of thing that veteran &rsquo;90s FPS players should already know to expect.)</p>

		<p>One particular region where players should take particular caution is the path to the southeastern house. A Mother of All Cyborgs teleports in when players are partway up it, and players are particularly vulnerable to attack there, considering how easy it is to get knocked off the ledge.</p>

		<p>One final hazard on this level, which you&rsquo;ll already know if you RTFM, is that spending too long in its near-freezing water will strip players&rsquo; shields. (However, it never directly kills them: it does energy drain damage to players, which never turns a player&rsquo;s health total negative, and players only die when their health total becomes negative. This means that energy drain damage can put a player in a situation where <em>any</em> non-energy drain damage will kill them, but it <em>cannot</em> kill them directly.)</p>

		<p>To balance out this level&rsquo;s difficult combat, I was fairly generous with health cans and extremely generous with ammo; I wanted to give players a reward that lasts beyond the level itself. As long as you save the health cans until you&rsquo;re below 1x, you probably won&rsquo;t run out of them, and I suspect you&rsquo;d have to have the absolute worst aim in the world (or never let go of the firing key even when there are no enemies around) to run out of ammo.</p>

		<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#mapmaking101.html">Beginners&rsquo; Guide</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking.html">Advanced guide</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My ludography</a> &middot; <a href="discography.html">My discography</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

		<h1 class="centred" id="secrets">Secrets</h1>

		<p>I try to keep my secrets &ldquo;fair&rdquo; &ndash; I almost always leave &ldquo;tells&rdquo; for them so that players can find them without just tabbing <em>every</em> wall. Thus:</p>

		<p>The wall between the opening room&rsquo;s book and the pattern buffer is a secret door that leads to a 2x canister, a rocket launcher, a second shotgun, and a large cache of ammo. (The tell for this, besides the blank wall itself being somewhat suspicious, is that the lightning on its exterior flickers differently than the surrounding areas&rsquo; lightning. I figured this secret would be extremely obvious, but at least three testers missed it. Goes to show that level designers aren&rsquo;t always the best judges of how obvious their signposting is. Since it&rsquo;s a secret, though, I haven&rsquo;t changed it at all.)</p>

		<p>In the room with the 2x canister in the southeastern house, jumping up to the northern corner and tabbing its eastern wall will reveal a secret room with a 3x canister, a flamethrower, and a large cache of ammo. (The tell for this is that the segment of the wall that contains a door flickers.) It&rsquo;s possible to get up here without grenade jumping, but it requires some fancy footwork &ndash; if your head hits the ceiling beam above the chair, the game will eject you out, but it&rsquo;ll let you ascend until your head hits the beam.</p>

		<p>Below the southwestern house that contains the exit are a 2x canister, an alien weapon, and a cache of ammo. You can get back up by following the winding pathway north from there. (The tell for this is&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s right out in the open. Just look down, or look at the map, or head south from the northwestern corner.) Be warned that picking this one up causes some monsters to teleport in.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;ve collected the first three secrets, you&rsquo;ll find a secret terminal and the fourth and final secret in the final house. There&rsquo;s no tell for this one until you collect the first three secrets, and after that point, you&rsquo;d have to be blind to miss it &ndash; it&rsquo;s on the far wall directly in front of the only entrance to the house.</p>

		<p>(The tell for &ldquo;KMG-365&rdquo;&rsquo;s secret exit to this level, meanwhile, is that the wall above and below the switch that unlocks the door that leads to the exit is textured differently from the surrounding areas, and once you activate it, the door itself is lit more brightly. I didn&rsquo;t actually change this texture from the original version of &ldquo;KMG-365&rdquo; &ndash; instead, I decided just to use it as a clue. The in-universe author of its secret exit terminal is <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/hathortimeline.html" target="_blank">an <em>Eternal</em> spoiler &ndash; the link in question will explain the chronology</a>. The opening paragraph borders on fourth-wall-breaking, since the game obviously can&rsquo;t know whether players have played recent versions of <em>Eternal</em>, but I figured those who had might get a kick out of it.)</p>

		<h1 class="centred" id="design">Design Notes</h1>
		I wanted <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> to have at least one exclusive original level from the moment I began working on it. James and I wound up making one each. James made &ldquo;The Library of Babel&rdquo;, the fantastic intermezzo between the original <em>Tempus Irae</em> campaign and <em>The Lost Levels</em>. I made this level. I initially gave it a placeholder name, &ldquo;Souretsu&rdquo; (Japanese for &ldquo;Funeral Procession&rdquo;, written &#xFF62;葬列&#xFF63; in kanji), which was literally just the song I was listening to when I created it (from Ringo Sh&imacr;na&rsquo;s 2003 masterpiece <em>Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana</em>).</p>

		<p>However, I soon renamed it &ldquo;Il grande silenzio&rdquo; (Italian for <em>The Great Silence</em>) after a fantastic 1968 spaghetti western directed by Sergio Corbucci, for several reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I wanted to use an Italian or Latin level title to fit <em>Tempus Irae</em>&rsquo;s Italian setting.</li>
			<li>Ennio Morricone had recently passed away, and I wanted to honour a film he had scored.</li>
			<li>Most of the film is set in remote, snowy, mountainous regions. This level is all three of those things.</li>
			<li>It&rsquo;s a fantastic, undeservedly obscure film. (Part of this is because 20th Century Fox refused to release it in the United States at the time; as a result, it was first officially released here in 2001 and wasn&rsquo;t theatrically screened here until <em>2017</em>.) But if you won&rsquo;t take my word for it, maybe its 100% approval rating and 8.1 Rotten Tomatoes average will convince you, or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121022213915/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/magazine/quentin-tarantino-django.html">Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s encomium to it will (spoiler warning)</a>.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>James made this landscape and a few of the snow textures specifically for this level, and they all turned out phenomenal. This level wouldn&rsquo;t have had nearly the same atmosphere or visual impact without them. I used Aleph One&rsquo;s new 2x transfer mode throughout the outdoor areas of this level to make its textures repeat less often. (I used this transfer mode several other places in <em>Redux</em> as well, but the only other place I used it this extensively was outside the cathedral in &ldquo;Downward Spiral&rdquo;.) This level&rsquo;s wind sound is relatively calm (befitting its title) and isn&rsquo;t used anywhere else in the game; beyond that, the loon sound and the hunter howls have had reverb added to them. All of this should combine to make the level feel a bit spookier than usual.</p>

		<p>As I often do, I began working on this level with a few specific inspirations in mind. The biggest two were <em>Tempus Irae</em> itself and the <em>Phoenix</em> level &ldquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rdquo;, the first <em>Marathon</em> level that ever made me feel like I was atop a treacherous mountain range. Effectively, this level&rsquo;s architecture and combat are both meant to fall roughly halfway between those of <em>Tempus</em> and <em>Phoenix</em>. I even adjusted several monsters to behave more like their <em>Phoenix</em> counterparts.</p>

		<p>If the waterfalls made you wonder how I got an engine that infamously isn&rsquo;t capable of having two polygons on the same side of a line to do true room-over-room, the answer is that I didn&rsquo;t. The underwater triangles are actually completely disconnected from the upper region; its Lua script warps players from one region to the other based on their physical height. I got the idea for this from a proof-of-concept made by aperturegrillz (who&rsquo;s best known as a speedrunner, though he&rsquo;s an accomplished mapmaker in his own right). Once I saw it demonstrated, though, I immediately figured out how to do it and subsequently wrote my own script for it, which I&rsquo;ve used in this level and a couple places in <em>Eternal</em>.</p>

		<p>At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if players would find this to be too big of a departure from <em>Tempus Irae</em>, which is one of several reasons I always intended it to be a secret level &ndash; so many scenarios have had weird secret levels over the years that secret levels tend to be taken on their own terms. Besides, I always intended this level to be challenging, and &ldquo;challenging&rdquo; is not in anyone&rsquo;s top descriptors of <em>Tempus Irae</em> as a whole. As it turns out, though, I needn&rsquo;t have worried: our testers have had uniformly positive feedback on the level, with at least one calling it their favorite in the game. Given the classics it&rsquo;s up against, that&rsquo;s high praise indeed.</p>

		<p>The first half of this level&rsquo;s soundtrack, called &ldquo;Cauda toxica&rdquo;, began life as a pastiche of Britney Spears&rsquo; &ldquo;Toxic&rdquo;, of all things, and before I&rsquo;d even finished it, I knew I wanted to use it here. As I worked on it, I also was inspired by Daft Punk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Get Lucky&rdquo;, Berlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Take My Breath Away&rdquo;, Genesis&rsquo; &ldquo;The Carpet Crawlers&rdquo;, and Ron Grainer & Delia Derbyshire&rsquo;s <em>Doctor Who</em> theme. The second half of this level&rsquo;s soundtrack was initially the second half of another track that ended up on &ldquo;Gates of Delirium&rdquo;. Using a 20-minute track there would&rsquo;ve been silly, but since this was in the same key as the piece I&rsquo;d written for this level, I moved it here. I titled it &laquo;Ἡ μεγᾰ́λη σιγή&raquo;, which is Ancient Greek for &ldquo;The Great Silence&rdquo; &ndash; the same thing the level title means in Italian.</p>

		<p>(&ldquo;Cauda toxica&rdquo; is Latin for &ldquo;Toxic Tail&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s a pun on a common Latin expression, <em>in cauda venenum</em>, or <em>venom in the tail</em>. &laquo;Ἡ μεγᾰ́λη σιγή&raquo;, romanized as &ldquo;H&emacr; megál&emacr; sigḗ&rdquo;, is Ancient Greek for &ldquo;The Great Silence&rdquo; &ndash; the same thing the level title means in Italian.)</p>

		<p>At 1,766 polygons, I believe this has the largest polygon count in <em>Tempus Irae Redux.</em> I initially wanted it to be even more complex than that, but Aleph One couldn&rsquo;t handle the complexity; it has a strict cap of 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup> &minus; 1) on an internal variable called map indices (which sounds like a lot, but it really, really isn&rsquo;t) and throws an assertion failure if a map exceeds it. In particular, I wanted this level&rsquo;s southern and western regions to be a lot more complex than they were, and the southeastern house in particular was supposed to have a second floor. Also, all the doors originally made ambient sounds as they moved, but I had to remove all sound objects from doors, because those use up more map indices than anything. (I also had to vastly cut the number of directional wind sounds for the same reason, though a few are still present.)</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in making your own levels (and if you&rsquo;ve read this far into the design notes, I figure there&rsquo;s a very high chance of that), I have <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/mapmaking101.html" target="_blank">beginner&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/mapmaking.html" target="_blank">advanced mapmaking guides</a>. As one appendix to these pages, I wrote <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/mapcomplexity.html" target="_blank">a case study comparing and contrasting this very level with three other mountainous levels</a>; I&rsquo;m linking it here rather than reprinting it in its entirety because it&rsquo;s very long, very image-heavy, and only partly related to this level. I also wrote <a href="https://aaronfreed.github.io/mapindexreduction.html" target="_blank">a follow-up</a> about how to reduce map index use without sacrificing complexity.</p>

		<h2 class="centred" id="mapwriting">Translations of Map Writing</h2>

		<p>Lastly, for those that look at maps in Weland, here are my explanations of the map writing:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>&ldquo;Tempus phoen&imacr;cis&rdquo; is Latin for <em>Time of the Phoenix</em>, mashing up <em>Tempus Irae</em> (<em>Time of Wrath</em>) with <em>Phoenix</em>.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Cre&amacr;ta ab Aaron Freed&rdquo; means &ldquo;Created by Aaron Freed&rdquo;. I used <em>cre&amacr;tus</em>&rsquo; feminine form because most words that mean <em>level</em> are feminine, and Latin adjectives match the gender and case of the nouns they describe.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Init. I&umacr;n MMXX&rdquo; means &ldquo;started June 2020&rdquo;. (The Romans probably would&rsquo;ve said something along the lines of &ldquo;inita in m&emacr;nse i&umacr;ni&omacr; MMXX&rdquo;, or &ldquo;started in the month of June 2020&rdquo;.)</li>
			<li>&ldquo;F&imacr;n. Feb MMXXV&rdquo; means &ldquo;finished February 2025&rdquo;. (Again, this would be &ldquo;f&imacr;n&imacr;ta in m&emacr;nse febru&amacr;ri&omacr; MMXXV&rdquo; in full. And of course, I wasn&rsquo;t working on this map for that entire time. I could go into a digression about how artists never actually finish works of art, they just stop working on them, but this is long enough already.)</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Gr&amacr;ti&amacr;s ag&omacr; Forgeflow, RyokoTK, et aperturegrillz&rdquo; is my list of thanks for this level. (&ldquo;Gr&amacr;ti&amacr;s ag&omacr;&rdquo; governs the dative case, so the sentence means &ldquo;I give thanks to Forgeflow, RyokoTK, and aperturegrillz&rdquo;.) Of those:
				<ul>
					<li>I thanked the first two because I felt I&rsquo;d gotten dangerously close to ripping off their styles. (Forgeflow is James&rsquo; screen name.) Ryoko also suggested making drones immune to each other&rsquo;s attacks, which made them far more threatening without being annoyingly tanky.</li>
					<li>I thanked aperturegrillz for inspiring the waterfall warp script.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>&ldquo;In memoriam&rdquo;, of course, means &ldquo;In memory of&rdquo;. This map is dedicated to the following individuals:
				<ul>
					<li>As already mentioned, Ennio Morricone scored this level&rsquo;s namesake, plus every other spaghetti western you can think of (and several you&rsquo;ve never heard of). He also scored most of John Carpenter&rsquo;s <em>The Thing</em> (Carpenter did most of the electronic bits himself) and Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s <em>The Hateful Eight</em> (which contains several direct tributes to this level&rsquo;s namesake). Morricone&rsquo;s score for <em>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</em> ties with <em>Blade Runner</em> (scored by Vangelis) as my favorite film score of all time; <em>Star Wars</em> (the entire trilogy, scored by John Williams) is #3, and you have to go a long way to find #4.</li>
					<li>Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Supreme Court justice. As this is neither the time nor the place for politics, I&rsquo;ll simply note how many barriers she broke during her lifetime.</li>
					<li>Devon Belcher designed &ldquo;It Was a Dark and Stormy Night&rdquo;, &ldquo;Epicus Doomicus Metallicus&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&rdquo;. He was also a philosophy teacher and avid metal fan, and though I never got the chance to speak to him, I got the impression that he was a kindred spirit. I was devastated to learn of his death.</li>
					<li>Steve Campbell designed &ldquo;The Revealing Science of God&rdquo; and &ldquo;From Now We Go On&rdquo;. He also ran one of the big <em>Marathon</em> repositories for several years. I was stunned and saddened to learn of his death, too.</li>
					<li>Duncan was my dog. The worst loss of all.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Compiler = MoAH, Defender = Enforcer pern&imacr;x, MoAH = MoAC maior&rdquo; are self-reminders about what monster slots in the physics represent. <em>Pern&imacr;x</em> means <em>fast</em>; <em>maior</em> means <em>major</em> (like most of its descendants, Latin usually places nouns before adjectives).</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Ann&imacr; MMXX, MMXXIV ac MMXXV&rdquo; means &ldquo;Years 2020, 2024, and 2025&rdquo;; as &ldquo;ann&imacr;&rdquo; is written in vocative case, it&rsquo;s directly addressing the years. <em>Ac</em>, sometimes also seen as <em>atque</em> or the suffix <em>-que</em> after the final entry in a list, implies a closer relationship than <em>et</em>.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;P&emacr;d&imacr;c&amacr;b&omacr; ego v&omacr;s et irrum&amacr;b&omacr;&rdquo; is a line I stole from the poet Catullus. Look up Catullus 16 if you need a translation, but be warned that it has been described, probably correctly, as the most obscene line ever written in any language. 2020, 2024, and the start of 2025 were or have been absolutely hellish for me; Catullus&rsquo; line felt like the most fitting expression of my frustration possible.</li>
		</ul>
