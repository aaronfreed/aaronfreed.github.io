	<h1 class="petitecaps"><em>Marathon Istoria</em>: Conversations with the Dead</h1>
	<p>This is a list of all possible messages that can obtained by communicating with the Yellow Crystal in the <strong>Aleph One</strong> scenario <em><strong>Marathon Istoria</strong></em>. A document of this type will inevitably contain massive gameplay and story spoilers, and consulting a guide of this sort can easily be considered &lsquo;cheating&rsquo;; turn back now if this bothers you.</p>

	<p>A few notes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If a body doesn&rsquo;t respond to a topic, none of the bodies in the game will respond to it.</li>
		<li>Multiple keywords that produce the same response are grouped together.</li>
		<li>The ending assigns points for each unique response from a body.
			<ul>
				<li>If you die without having saved since a conversation, you&rsquo;ll need to repeat it to get the points.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Numbering is per the game&rsquo;s internal code. The URLs that point to each body use the game&rsquo;s internal reference indicator for that body following the <strong>#</strong> sign.</li>
	</ul>

			<td class="response">I'm Lieutenant Anderson. Malcolm Anderson.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">death<br />dead</td>
			<td class="response">It all happened so fast. We had just landed, and I was trying to get off the ship. I opened the starboard airlock and the Pfhor were already there, waiting. I ran and jumped down here, but I broke my leg. They finished me not long after.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">unknown1</td>
			<td class="response">My leg hurts... that's all I can think about right now.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">unknown2</td>
			<td class="response">I'd never broken a bone before today. I thought I'd make it my whole life. Just goes to show you it's all a big nothing.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">unknown3</td>
			<td class="response">I'm getting cold... Maybe you should let me be. I'm sorry.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">ship</td>
			<td class="response">This is the Kolyma. One of the Tripoli's dozen dropships. Typically my post is on the Tripoli, but our mission today called for us to take the Kolyma to Istoria's furthest moon to conduct several experiments involving you and those so-called spells you carry. But the attack happened before we could get started, and Sullivan ordered us to take you to the surface to help our forces there.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">tripoli</td>
			<td class="response">The Tripoli is our defense warship. The only warship here at Istoria. I don't know what happened to her, but she wasn't in good condition after the Pfhor launched their assault.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">istoria<br />here</td>
			<td class="response">Istoria's a mostly barren rock. Beyond the small Mrrak outpost, there are only endless mountain ranges surrounded by lifeless lakes and rivers. And now I'm trapped here forever. Oh, god...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">pfhor<br />attack</td>
			<td class="response">The Pfhor came out of nowhere, completely evading our sensors. The Tripoli didn't even declare general quarters until after the attack started.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">barren<br />lifeless</td>
			<td class="response">Istoria has been lifeless for about a thousand years, so the archaeologists tell us.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">archaeologists</td>
			<td class="response">They sent a whole team of archaeologists to study the ancient ruins on this planet. I don't know much about the things they've learned. I preferred serving aboard the Tripoli and seeing Istoria from orbit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">sullivan</td>
			<td class="response">General Sullivan commands the Tripoli and all forces assigned to Project Cygnus. He reports directly to the UESC's CIC. A bit of a micro-manager, if you ask me. A lieutenant such as myself shouldn't have that many direct interactions with him regarding my duties, but I get it when it comes to the classification levels we're dealing with here.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">home</td>
			<td class="response">Earth is a long way from here, even with the FTL technology we now have. It takes about five months of consistent travel at FTL speeds to get home.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">leg</td>
			<td class="response">Even though I'm dead, my leg still hurts like hell. How do you figure that?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">laser</td>
			<td class="response">I took one of the laser spells from the armory on the off chance I ran across you. Too little too late, I guess. Lasers are great for sniping or stunning enemies, from what I've seen.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">project<br />cygnus</td>
			<td class="response">Project Cygnus involved the extensive study and development of cyborgs such as yourself. We were running tests on the spells while aboard the Tripoli and Kolyma. Spells don't work once they get far enough away from Istoria, rendering them useless to the UESC. If we can just get them to work, we could produce an army of cyborgs such as yourself, armed with spells. It would mean the end of the Pfhor. I guess it's all a big wash now.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">cyborg<br /> you</td>
			<td class="response">I don't know a lot about you. Just that you died in some sort of accident, and were then reanimated into the cyborg you are now. At least, that's what your personal dossier indicated. Truth be told, a lot of cyborgs passed through here before you. It might sound bad, but you all started to seem the same to me. I don't even remember what class you are. Do you?</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">lieutenant</td>
			<td class="response">My main post is aboard the Tripoli. Today we took one of the Tripoli's drop ships to run several experiments with you.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">blue<br />key</td>
			<td class="response">I'm glad you took my blue key earlier. Hopefully you took everything you could from the armory. If you happen to come across a red key, there are a few more spells and ammo in the laboratory directly across from the armory.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">trapped</td>
			<td class="response">I never felt this way in my post aboard the Tripoli, but many personnel on the surface felt like they were trapped because their deployment had been extended. Personally, I don't think they appreciated the position humanity finds itself in regarding our war with the Pfhor. We should all be willing to make the ultimate sacrifices for the survival of humanity.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">moon</td>
			<td class="response">For a while, we've thought that spells only worked in close proximity to Istoria, creating a significant problem for their future proliferation. Recently, however, it appears they also seem to work in close proximity to Istoria's most distant moon, Kilauea.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">kilauea</td>
			<td class="response">I guess they named it that due to the volcanic activity on the surface or something. Bit of a weird name, if you ask me.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">experiments</td>
			<td class="response">As you've probably already found out, spells work with your advanced cybernetic components. But they can be unpredictable and undependable. For instance, spells don't really work far beyond Istoria. As a result, we've been tasked with running various experiments to see how they interact with you and your suit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">suit</td>
			<td class="response">Your suit is a mix of the most cutting-edge UESC technology, some repurposed Jjaro components, and a whole lot of love for the human race. If we could have only had more time to work with you, who knows what could have happened...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">spells</td>
			<td class="response">Everyone calls them spells because there's something we don't know that makes them tick. You could say it's magical, but that's just because we don't understand it yet. I guess we never will.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">ruins</td>
			<td class="response">They say the aliens who once lived here were called the Mrrak or something. Apparently, they bear a resemblance to the S'pht. I don't know much about them, honestly.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">mrrak</td>
			<td class="response">Like I said, I don't really know much about the Mrrak.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">wasserman</td>
			<td class="response">Wasserman reports directly to General Sullivan. I don't know much about him since his work takes place below Istoria's surface. Sometimes it seems like he exists outside the chain of command, though...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">class</td>
			<td class="response">We had seven separate cyborg classes, each with its own unique abilities. Rifleman, pyrotechnic, deceiver, to name a few...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">rifleman</td>
			<td class="response">Riflemen are unique in that they have two specific abilities: near-perfect SMG aim with extremely fast bullets, and gravity grenades when using the Assault Rifle. It's especially unsettling watching a rifleman pull a group of enemies together to use a lightning spell on them. Remarkably efficient and effective, if you ask me.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">fusion<br />master<br />fusionmaster</td>
			<td class="response">I don't understand how their fusion bolts can chain from one organism to the next, but it's astonishing to witness. Though it's nothing compared to when a fusion master unleashes seeking fusion bolts whilst also using a fury spell. Absolute chaos. But I can tell you that I'd want a fusion master by my side if I came face-to-face with a juggernaut, any day.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">telekinetic</td>
			<td class="response">I'd want a telekinetic with me if I were near the cliffs or the magma caves below ground. Some place where they could shove the Pfhor to a horrific death. I guess I'd have to trust that they wouldn't eventually do the same to me, though...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">deceiver</td>
			<td class="response">You get a deceiver to mind-control one of those gold Enforcers, they'll take out an entire Pfhor landing party in seconds. Or what about one of those grenade juggernauts? I wish we had the time to manufacture more of you, to be honest. From any class.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">timekeeper</td>
			<td class="response">Timekeeper. What a promising class. Imagine being able to freeze time in the middle of combat. You could clean up whoever you wanted. Or use it as a get-out-of-jail-free card. I still couldn't tell you the science behind the timekeeper ability. They don't pay me enough to understand that stuff.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">pyro<br />pyrotechnic</td>
			<td class="response">I wouldn't want to be on a pyro's bad side, to be sure. I've seen a pyrotechnic use his TOZT to throw flame from one side of a valley to the next. It immediately caught a poor scientist on fire. The guy didn't make it, but he lasted longer than he should have...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="topic">rocket<br />man<br />rocketman</td>
			<td class="response">The end result of cyborg augmentation, in my opinion. Their homing missiles are terrifying to see. I often think if two cyborg armies found themselves facing off in combat, the ensuing battle would devolve into a slaughter fest of nothing but missile hellfire.</td>
