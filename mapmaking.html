<h1>Marathon Mapmaking: Setup, Snafus, & Solutions</h1>
  
<p>This document is a guide to content creation for <strong><a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" target="_blank">Marathon Aleph One</a></strong>, an open-source engine based on <strong>Bungie</strong>'s groundbreaking first-person shooter trilogy (1994-1996). <strong>With the exception of the <a href="#welandsetup">Weland setup guide</a>, this is designed as an advanced document; see &lsquo;<a href="#tutorialsother">Other Tutorials & Resources</a>&rsquo; for guides to basic mapmaking principles, which you should definitely familiarize yourself with before moving onto more advanced tricks.</strong></p>
  
<p>This guide contains overviews of common problems creators may face (and solutions thereto), plus links to editors, other useful guides/resources, and communities where users may be able to find solutions to problems not covered here. It is meant to help troubleshoot several problems with Marathon content creation that, as far as I know, aren&rsquo;t documented anywhere else well, if at all.</p>
  
<h1 id="bio">Who are you and what qualifies you to write this?</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m Aaron; I&rsquo;m likely best-known in the community for co-directing <em><a href="http://eternal.bungie.org/development" target="_blank">Eternal</a></em>, though I&rsquo;ve also worked in some capacity (not always mapping-related) on current and forthcoming mods like <em><a href="https://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5" target="_blank">Apotheosis X</a></em>, <em><a href="https://simplici7y.com/items/dungeons-hellpak-vol-1-not-recommended-by-doctors" target="_blank">Hellpak</a></em>, <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>, <em>Where Monsters Are in Dreams</em>, <em>Marathon Chronicles</em>&hellip;basically, I&rsquo;ve been busy mapping for this engine off and on since about 1997, during which I&rsquo;ve acquired all kinds of stupid arcane knowledge about it. Have you ever heard of ambient light delta? Neither had Aleph One&rsquo;s developers until I pointed it out. I&rsquo;m not saying that because I think it&rsquo;s worth being proud of having acquired so much useless and pointless knowledge, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me&hellip; oh, sorry, that&rsquo;s <em>Taken</em>. Anyway, I feel Aleph One content creation should have a lower barrier to entry, so here&rsquo;s an attempt to create a reference for solutions to some of its frustrating problems.</p>

<p>If you wish to contact me, the best way is via Discord. You can ping me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY" target="_blank">Marathon Discord server</a> at <strong>@Aaron#6608</strong>, though it&rsquo;s entirely possible others may be able to answer your questions before I see them, so I&rsquo;d recommend this only if you notice errors/omissions in this document (or have suggestions for additions; I can credit you for all three). If you need help, it&rsquo;s best to ask in <strong>#marathon-general</strong>, <strong>#forge</strong>, or <strong>#tech-support</strong> (<strong>#development</strong> is for engine/editor development). I&rsquo;m also on the <a href="https://pfhorums.com" target="_blank">Pfhorums</a> (as <a href="https://pfhorums.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6618" target="_blank">The Man</a>) and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/marathon/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> (as <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aaronnotarobot" target="_blank">u/aaronnotarobot</a>), but I can&rsquo;t promise to respond to messages on either quickly.</p>

<p>You may also be interested in my <a href="soundtracks.html"><em>Marathon</em> soundtracks page</a>, which contains some technical information about remastering music and sounds that may be helpful to those working on sounds or music.</p>

<h2 id="resourcesm1"><em>Marathon 1</em> Content Editing for Aleph One</h2>

It&rsquo;s not supported on modern OSes, with one partial exception: You can extract <em>M1</em> sound files&rsquo; contents by splitting them with Atque, but it won&rsquo;t re-merge them into a format Aleph One reads as <em>M1</em> sounds. The &lsquo;Classic OS&rsquo; resources below require a Mac or emulator running System 7 through 9. Setting one up is beyond this document&rsquo;s scope.
<ul style="text-align: left;">

Terminals are TEXT resources in the Marathon application. Explaining the terminal format is beyond the current scope of this guide, though I may cover it eventually.</li></ul>

To make this content compatible with modern Aleph One, you must run it through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBinary" target="_blank">MacBinary</a> (I&rsquo;ve never gotten this to work) or extract it from an emulator disk image with a program like <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7358-hfvexplorer-1-3-1-for-windows-" target="_blank">HFV Explorer</a> (the method I used for my remastered <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-1-remastered-sounds-2" target="_blank"><em>Marathon 1</em></a> and <a href="https://hhas01.itch.io/trojan-se" target="_blank"><em>Trojan</em></a> sounds).

<p>I can&rsquo;t vouch for the accuracy of all of this info (besides the Github wiki), but start with the Forge manual and tutorials; they aren&rsquo;t 100% accurate (hence the errata below), but you need to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals before moving onto more advanced techniques.

<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<h2 id="welandsetup">Weland Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Setting up Weland can be confusing; this doesn&rsquo;t aim to be an exhaustive list of the issues you may face in doing so. I can&rsquo;t possibly hope to provide that here; you&rsquo;ll find people who can help on the <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY">Discord</a>.</li>
  <li>You&rsquo;ll need either <strong>Gtk#</strong> or <strong>Mono</strong>, depending on your OS; the readme tells you which to get. (You&rsquo;ll also need <strong>.NET</strong> on Windows; however, Windows 10 and 11 should already have this installed.) Installing the wrong one sometimes seems to make Weland not work, and they&rsquo;re on the same webpage, so users can get one thinking they&rsquo;ve gotten the other. Read carefully!</li>
  <li>After getting Weland to start, you&rsquo;ll next want to set up visual mode to function from within Weland. Go to <strong>Edit > Preferences</strong>. You&rsquo;ll want the <strong>Shapes</strong> and <strong>Visual Mode</strong> segments to resemble these settings:</li>

<div class="image"><img src="welandprefs.png" alt="Weland preferences" title="Weland preferences" height="184" width="316" /></div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shapes File:</strong> valid <em>Marathon 2</em>/<em>Infinity</em>-format shapes. <em>Marathon 1</em> shapes probably won&rsquo;t work, but I haven&rsquo;t tested this. This affects what Weland uses in visual mode and the overhead texture view.</li>
      <li><strong>Aleph One:</strong> the Aleph One app. EZ.</li>
      <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> the folder you use within Aleph One to run the scenario you&rsquo;re editing. This is <em>usually</em> the folder with <strong>Map</strong>, <strong>Shapes</strong>, <strong>Images</strong>, and <strong>Sounds</strong>, but <em>Rubicon X</em> is an annoying exception: it uses a script to put these in a <strong>Rubicon Data</strong> subfolder. Use the containing <strong>Rubicon X</strong> folder, <em>not</em> Rubicon Data, for <em>Rubicon</em>.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to set up an editor for visual mode. The two options are currently Visual Mode.lua and Vasara. Whichever one you choose must be accessible by the scenario you wish to edit.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong> is a solo Lua script; this should go in the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank"><strong>Aleph One user data folder</strong></a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Vasara</strong> is a plugin, so you&rsquo;ll want it in the <strong>Plugins</strong> folder (if there isn&rsquo;t one already, make a folder called <strong>&lsquo;Plugins&rsquo;</strong>. It can go either in the scenario plugins folder (<strong>Marathon Infinity\Plugins\Vasara.zip</strong> in our <em>Infinity</em> example), or in the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank"><strong>Aleph One user data</strong></a> plugins folder to make it accessible to all scenarios (which may be more convenient if you map for several scenarios, though you may have to turn it off in the main games).</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Then, click <strong>&lsquo;Edit Preferences&rsquo;</strong>. In Aleph One, click <strong>Settings > Environment</strong>. These are separate from the standard scenario preferences; they only affect the game&rsquo;s behavior when it&rsquo;s launched from Weland.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For Visual Mode.lua:</strong> check <strong>&lsquo;Use Solo Script&rsquo;</strong> if it isn&rsquo;t already, then select <strong>&lsquo;Script File&rsquo;</strong> and find Visual Mode.lua in Aleph One&rsquo;s user data folder (Aleph One usually navigates from this folder by default).</li>
      <li><strong>For Vasara:</strong> Select it under <strong>Plugins</strong>; no other plugins that use solo Lua should be active, and <strong>&lsquo;Use Solo Script&rsquo;</strong> should be unchecked. If it doesn&rsquo;t show up, you may have copied it to the wrong location.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>In either case, now select <strong>&lsquo;Accept&rsquo;</strong>, quit out of Aleph One, and select <strong>&lsquo;OK&rsquo;</strong> in the Weland dialog box. If you&rsquo;ve done everything correctly, you should now be able to launch visual mode in much the same way it launched from within Forge. If not, reread the above, try to ensure everything is set up as shown here, and if you still can&rsquo;t solve the issue, you may wish to ask for help at one of the above resources.
    
     <p>I should perhaps note that several Windows users have reported that they&rsquo;ve only been able to get Weland to run correctly by using Gtk# 2.12.26 &ndash; a completely ancient release. No one has been able to produce a satisfactory hypothesis for why this is the case, but enough people have experienced it that it&rsquo;s ceased to look like coincidence. (For the record, I didn&rsquo;t have to do this to get Weland to work on Windows; in fact, the setup process was quite painless for me.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="ShapeFusion">ShapeFusion</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can rename ShapeFusion resources by adding a file called <strong>DefaultNames.txt</strong> to your ShapeFusion folder. (You can also, of course, keep multiple ShapeFusion installs with different DefaultNames.txt files in each folder if you need versions for multiple scenarios.) Below is <a href="#defaultnames">a version of DefaultNames.txt</a> incorporating complete lists of the Lua mnemonics for all possible resources, with a few specific changes, all detailed at the start of the file. Feel free to use these as needed to create names for your own scenarios.</li>
  <li>ShapeFusion has most of <strong>Anvil</strong>&rsquo;s functionality, plus some functionality Anvil lacks (e.g. the ability to add new sound slots or alter the frames in a sequence). However, it lacks two major features:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Anvil&rsquo;s help balloons. These are compiled with asides <a href="#anvilhelp">near the end of this document</a>.</li>
      <li>It can&rsquo;t create new physics models. The physics model that ships with <em>Infinity</em> is a <em>Marathon 2</em> physics model and thus lacks SMG and VacBob slots, but <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/default-infinity-physics-model-2" target="_blank">Simplici7y</a> has a complete <em>Infinity</em> physics model.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>An annoying bug displays the <strong>Scale Factors</strong> of new frames as being above 0, but actually sets them to 0. The game doesn&rsquo;t display frames with 0 scale factors (i.e., &lsquo;multiply size by 0&rsquo;). Be sure to fix this.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h1 id="shapes"><h1>Shapes & Palettes</h1>
<h2 id="clutrestrictions">Restrictions on Number of Colors</h2>

<p>Palettes (also called <strong>CLUTs</strong>, short for <strong>Color Look-Up Tables</strong>, the name for these resources in MacOS&rsquo; resource fork in the classic OS) can pose particular problems. One particular issue occurs with non-standard CLUTs.</p>

<ol>
  <li>We&rsquo;re restricted to 256 colors not just <em>within one palette</em> but <em>across all eight palettes within a collection</em>. If there are more than 256, then once it runs out, Aleph One will simply use the closest color it encounters among the first 256.</li>
  <li>Aleph One counts colors that are imperceptibly different as separate colors. For instance, it regards #0100FF (red 1, green 0, blue 255) as different from #0200FF (red 2, green 0, blue 255).</li>
  <li>Unlike Anvil (which tried to restrict itself to vanilla-safe colors unless you specifically enabled a setting to override this), ShapeFusion isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to use the same colors each time it creates a color ramp unless each ramp starts and ends with the same color and contains the same number of colors.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s a mess. Two ways to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the 256 colors you want:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export all color tables in a collection to GIMP format (.gpl) and go through them with a fine-toothed comb. GIMP palettes are human-readable and can be edited in any text editor; each color is simply listed in RGB format, with values ranging from 0 to 255. After weeding out the unwanted near-identical colors across palettes, save and reimport.</li>
  <li>Simply use all 256 colors you want in CLUT 0 and rearrange them as desired in the others if needed. Be warned, however, that ShapeFusion currently has no option to reduce the number of colors per CLUT, should you decide you want fewer. You&rsquo;d currently need to open the shapes file in Anvil or Hakvil (using an emulator or a classic Mac) and adjust the palettes there.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that using non-vanilla palettes causes 8-bit software mode to look very, very stupid, in case anyone even cares about that in a scenario created in 2022. I don&rsquo;t actually know how it selects the colors for that.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="transparency">Transparency & Landscapes</h2>

<p><em>Marathon</em> counts the first three colors of each CLUT as transparent, whether you want it to or not. Why does it need three? Why not just one? In all likelihood, only Jason Jones might be able to answer this question, assuming he even remembers the answer. This poses problems with custom landscape CLUTs. Why do landscapes even have transparency? Another question Jason Jones probably doesn&rsquo;t recall the answer to. The first three colors in a landscape CLUT are still considered transparent, and in OpenGL mode, <em>Marathon</em> changes anything it regards as transparent to show up as white.</p>

<p>As a result, for all practical purposes, landscape CLUTs are restricted to 253 colors, so when generating landscape CLUTs, you must account for transparency and fill the CLUT&rsquo;s first three colors with garbage that won&rsquo;t show up in the landscape. Alternately (in Photoshop), you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convert to 253-color indexed color.</li>
<li>Convert back to RGB.</li>
<li>Using <strong>Forced &gt; Custom</strong> with #0000FF, #FF00FF, and #00FFFF, convert to 256-color indexed color.</li>
<li>Export the new CLUT.</li>
</ol>

<p>Either way. (I don&rsquo;t use GIMP, but I&rsquo;m guessing you can do something similar by making a 253-color bitmap, exporting the CLUT, and editing it in a text editor.)</p>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="sequencetiming">Sequence Timing & Film Compatibility</h2>

<ul><li>Ideally, &lsquo;Transfer mode period&rsquo; should equal &lsquo;Frames per view&rsquo; times &lsquo;Number of frames&rsquo;.</li>

<li>Changing a sequence&rsquo;s timing, loop frame, or key frame can desync films. (Probably obvious.)</li>

<li>Another surprising factor affecting film sync: &lsquo;Display a random frame&rsquo; (even if only one frame is defined) is different from &lsquo;Animation with 1 view&rsquo; (or any other number). Altering this alters the PRNG when the game loads maps, since it runs the PRNG for each sequence that uses &lsquo;Display a random frame&rsquo;, even if it only has one frame. Thus, changing a sequence from or to &lsquo;Display a random frame&rsquo; desyncs old films made with the same shapes. (I haven&rsquo;t tested whether this also desyncs network games.)</li></ul>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h1 id="8bitsoftware">8-bit Software Mode</h1>

<p>Aleph One 1.4 restored 8-bit software mode after it had been unavailable for over a decade. I&rsquo;ve given this its own section because it doesn&rsquo;t strictly belong in either the shapes section or the mapmaking section; it causes potential havoc in territory related to both ShapeFusion (shapes sequences) and Atque (images files, map resources).</p>

<h2 id="weaponsinhand">&lsquo;Weapons in Hand&rsquo; Sequences</h2>

<p>For years, Aleph One didn&rsquo;t have 8-bit software mode, so &lsquo;8-bit color&rsquo; and &lsquo;true color&rsquo; sequences being out of alignment wasn&rsquo;t a problem. Since it does again, if a sequence is present in one and not the other, a physics model calling said sequence will crash Aleph One (or cause an assertion failure; I forget which, but either way, it closes the game). Plus, if a sequence has a different timing between the two versions of a collection, it&rsquo;ll desync films and may desync network games if one player uses 8-bit software mode and the other doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>As tempting as it is to tell players not to use 8-bit software mode, some will inevitably disregard it out of ignorance, and others out of pure spite (&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me what to do&rsquo;). The best solution is to make sure each sequence in both versions has the same sequence type, frames per view, ticks per frame, loop frame, key frame, transfer mode period, and frame sound, then update one anytime you update the other.</p>

<p>By default, the only other collections with &lsquo;true color&rsquo; versions are the landscape palettes, and it&rsquo;s very rare (though not unthinkable) for something to call one of the sequences in these (assuming any are even defined). I think a classic Mac utility could create &lsquo;true color&rsquo; versions of other collections (all 32 collections can have them; it&rsquo;s just that, by default, only the Weapons in Hand and Landscapes did), and if a shapes file had these, their sequences should align between &lsquo;8-bit&rsquo; and &lsquo;true color&rsquo; wherever they&rsquo;re defined.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="8bitsoftwareimages">The Images File</h2>

<p>The Images file should have at least images 1100 and 1101 (&lsquo;enabled&rsquo; and &lsquo;disabled&rsquo; versions of the main menu) and 1700 (the vanilla HUD). It also needs CLUT resources with the same IDs. If it lacks images 1100 and 1101, the menu will show up black if a player selects 8-bit software, and if they then quit the game, they&rsquo;ll either need to delete their scenario preferences or to manually edit them to change the graphics settings (on the very slim chance that they even know how to do this). Effectively, this will render the scenario unplayable for many players.</p>

<p>For full reference, the resources in Images correspond to the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>1000:</strong> Opening splash screen. If 1001, 1002, 1003, etc., are defined, the game subsequently displays each before loading the main menu. (Please don&rsquo;t overdo this.)</li>
<li><strong>1100:</strong> &lsquo;Disabled&rsquo; main menu.</li>
<li><strong>1101:</strong> &lsquo;Enabled&rsquo; main menu.</li>
<li><strong>1400, 1401, 1402, etc.:</strong> Credits pages. The game loads as many consecutive resources as are defined.</li>
<li><strong>1700:</strong> Default HUD.</li></ul>

<p>Add 1,000 to each of these numbers for the &lsquo;24-bit&rsquo; versions. It&rsquo;s ideal to have separate 8-bit and 24-bit versions, as IIRC, Photoshop and GIMP dither images much better than Aleph One does.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="chapterscreens">Chapter Screens & Sounds</h2>

<p>Aleph One won&rsquo;t display a chapter screen in 8-bit software mode unless it has an associated CLUT resource sharing the chapter screen&rsquo;s resource ID. Make sure to include these if you care about 8-bit software mode at all. Chapter screens go from 1500 (for level 0) to 1599 (for the end screen or, God help us all, level 99). Add 10,000 for &lsquo;24-bit&rsquo; versions and (I found this one out the hard way &ndash; by noticing it after a scenario release) 20,000 for &lsquo;32-bit&rsquo; versions. (This effectively makes 115xx and 215xx unusable if you have a level xx &ndash; but I&rsquo;m not sure if Aleph One will ever display the 115xx picture when the 215xx exists, so if you use 215xx for the chapter screen, you might be able to get away with using 115xx for a terminal picture.)</p>
  
<p>Also, if there&rsquo;s an associated sound sharing the 15xx ID, Aleph One will play it. This includes ending screens (though Aleph One also plays the music file, so it&rsquo;s probably not worth including a sound 1599 unless you plan for your scenario not to have opening music).</p>

<h1 id="mapmaking">Mapmaking</h1>
<h2 id="forgeerrata">Forge Manual Errata & Omissions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> The &lsquo;Locked Door&rsquo; flag is broken and doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Lights:</strong> The &lsquo;Stateless&rsquo; flag is broken and doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Environment Types:</strong> The description of &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>&rsquo; is completely incorrect; it is a correct description of &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion (M1)</strong>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>  &rsquo; flag strips all players&rsquo; weapons and ammunition, and if their health is above 37 (full 1x shields would be 150), the game strips their health to 37. Additionally, if the &lsquo;<strong>Extermination</strong>&rsquo; mission type is set on a <strong>Rebellion</strong> level, <em>all</em> monsters must be killed, <em>without exception</em>, for the mission status to be set as complete.</li>
  <li><strong>Mission Types:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>&lsquo;<strong>Rescue</strong>&rsquo; is broken. Use &lsquo;<strong>Rescue (M1)</strong>&rsquo; if you want this behaviour. Additionally, the &lsquo;<strong>Rescue (M1)</strong>&rsquo; mission affects whether the mission type is set as &lsquo;<strong>Failed</strong>&rsquo;; it is still up to the mapmaker to set &lsquo;<strong>Finished</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Unfinished</strong>&rsquo; state. See aperturegrillz&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/rMSyuAsnIfc" target="_blank">speedrun of &lsquo;Bob-B-Q&rsquo;</a> for an example of what can happen when a mapmaker forgets to set another mission type besides &lsquo;<strong>Repair (M1)</strong>&rsquo;.</li>
      <li>&lsquo;<strong>Extermination</strong>&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t require killing <em>everything</em> unless, as mentioned above, the &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>&rsquo; flag is set. Otherwise, the player is given a leeway of up to eight monsters that have the &lsquo;<strong>Alien</strong>&rsquo; flag set in their physics. The game does not count monsters without the &lsquo;<strong>Alien</strong>&rsquo; flag set, and whether they are set as being hostile to the player is of no importance. It is also possible to force certain monster types to be killed using MML.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sound Objects:</strong> &lsquo;Is On Platform&rsquo; overrides the selected sound with the platform&rsquo;s ambient sound.</li>
  <li><strong>Polygon Types:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>&lsquo;Invisible Monster Trigger&rsquo; behaves like a &lsquo;Dual Monster Trigger&rsquo;: it activates all monsters in a zone, not just teleporting ones.</li>
      <li>Only players can trigger <strong>Platform On/Off Triggers</strong>, but both players and monsters can trigger <strong>Light On/Off Triggers</strong>.</li>
      <li>Monsters can&rsquo;t move over <strong>Teleporters</strong> and won&rsquo;t cross them (this doesn&rsquo;t apply to <strong>Automatic Exits</strong>).</li>
      <li>Although monsters usually can&rsquo;t move in <strong>Monster & Item Impassable</strong> polygons, they can if the player is in the same polygon they are. Also, they have been known to disregard the polygon type occasionally and enter it, although I&rsquo;m not at all sure what causes this; and of course, they can get pushed in.</li>
      <li>Monsters never drop items if they die on <strong>Item Impassable</strong>, <strong>Monster & Item Impassable</strong>, <strong>Platform</strong>, or <strong>Teleporter</strong> polygons, or on the edges of steps/ledges/cliffs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="generalmapmaking">General Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Test your maps extensively on Total Carnage. If you&rsquo;re not good enough, get someone who is to test it. If you <em>are</em> good enough, note that you have a sort of &lsquo;home field advantage&rsquo; in already knowing the maps and your intended strategies &ndash; other players will find your maps harder than you think they will. Also, if something annoys you, it&rsquo;ll annoy other players ten times more.</li>
  <li>Monsters can&rsquo;t move through lines shorter than their diameters, as <a href="https://citadel.lhowon.org/litterbox/Forge/hastursworkshop/things2.html" target="_blank">Hastur&rsquo;s Workshop explains</a>. This link also features plenty of other vital information about monster path building.</li>
  <li>Aleph One removes the 1,024 polygon limit, but a factor called map indices still limits map complexity, as Aleph One developer treellama explained <a href="http://pfhorums.com/viewtopic.php?p=73316#p73316" target="_blank">on the Pfhorums</a> (though the limit is now 65,535, not 32,767). The tl;dr is:
    <ul>
      <li>Use as few sound objects as possible (but see below).</li>
      <li>Avoid clusters of small polygons and/or short lines.</li>
      <li>If you can cut out a line or polygon without affecting the map&rsquo;s appearance or monster path building (see the Hastur&rsquo;s Workshop explanation above), always cut it out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>There are several hazards with the <strong>Activates Only Once</strong> flag for platforms (i.e., lifts and doors). Misusing this is one of the most common causes of incompletable levels.
    <ul>
      <li>These should always, <em>always</em>, <strong><em>ALWAYS</em></strong> have <strong>Can&rsquo;t Deactivate Externally</strong> checked. I can&rsquo;t stress this strongly enough. If a door that&rsquo;s meant to open deactivates before it finishes doing so, that can render a level incompletable, and to compound the matter, players may save their games in such a state.
         <ul><li>The only <em>possible</em> acceptable exception to this rule is for missable secrets, but I&rsquo;d strongly discourage even that. If you absolutely <em>must</em> have a missable secret (please don&rsquo;t make your secrets missable), provide a way out for players caught on the wrong sides of doors, and make sure any teleporters are usable (i.e., test them in-game).</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>Also, if such a door is <strong>Initially Extended</strong>, it should deactivate either <strong>At Each Level</strong> or <strong>Never</strong>. If it isn&rsquo;t, it should deactivate either <strong>At Initial Level</strong> or <strong>Never</strong>.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, lifts that activate <strong>Only Once</strong> should probably deactivate <strong>Never</strong>. Otherwise, a player might be able to activate it, get off the lift, and be unable to get back up; this can also cause problems in cooperative games (if those are enabled).
        <ul><li>Platforms that are <strong>Initially Extended</strong> and <strong>Deactivate at Each Level</strong> may be possible exceptions to this, but you should still test them extensively.</li></ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Speaking of which, teleporters (and automatic exit polygons) behave oddly with media. If there&rsquo;s a liquid on the teleporter, it probably shouldn&rsquo;t have a current.</li>
  <li>It isn&rsquo;t necessary to move the player&rsquo;s start point to texture maps in Weland; just select the arrow, hold down X, make sure caps lock is off, and click on a polygon to set a start point.</li>
</ul>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="scripts">Scripts, Monster Limits, & Music</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you&rsquo;re making a solo-only map, you have two ways to merge in scripts. You can save the above script as a TEXT resource (i.e., <strong>Resources/TEXT/10000.txt</strong>) and calling it in TEXT resource 128 (i.e., <strong>Resources/TEXT/00128.txt</strong>):</li>
<pre>    &lt;marathon_levels&gt;
      &lt;level index="0"&gt;
        &lt;lua resource="420"&gt;
        &lt;mml resource="10000"/&gt;
        &lt;music file="Eternal-Data/Music/Craig/SwirlsPiano.ogg"/&gt;
      &lt;/level&gt;
    &lt;/marathon_levels&gt;</pre>
  Or by including MML in each individual level&rsquo;s folder (i.e., <strong>00 The Far Side of Nowhere/Monster Limits.mml</strong>).

  <div style="margin-top: 8px;">On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re making a multiplayer level for an existing scenario (this includes cooperative play), it&rsquo;s actually <em><strong>mandatory</strong></em> to use the latter method in most cases, since the game doesn&rsquo;t send TEXT resources to other players, so if you use it for something that affects the game world, which includes limit-removing MML and most Lua, players will desync almost immediately. If you don&rsquo;t know if your script will affect the game world, it&rsquo;s safest to just assume it will. MML texture replacements, fog, and Treellama&rsquo;s ephemera-based precipitation script are some examples of things that don&rsquo;t affect the game world.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 8px;"><span id="ftnt_ref1" class="dotted" title="What, you don&rsquo;t have a third hand? Then you must not be Zaphod Beeblebrox.">On the third hand<a href="#ftnt1">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>, if you&rsquo;re making a standalone scenario, you can include an MML script that includes the scenario and version number, which prevents anyone who <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> running that scenario and version number from joining network games. In these cases, you can safely assume anyone who <em>does</em> join your game already has the map, in which case they&rsquo;ll also have the scripts already and won&rsquo;t desync.</div>

  <pre>
    &lt;marathon&gt;
      &lt;scenario id="Eternal X" name="Eternal X" version="1.3pre4" /&gt;
    &lt;/marathon&gt;</pre>

  <div style="margin-top: 8px;">(Moving the map file out of the scenario folder or overwriting it with a different version of the map would fall into what I&rsquo;d consider &lsquo;Play stupid games, win stupid prizes&rsquo; territory. You may wish to put a caveat about this in your game&rsquo;s documentation, but I&rsquo;d imagine this would be a relatively rare occurrence.)</div></li>

  <li>OpenGL replacement textures are a special case. They don&rsquo;t affect the game world, but they also shouldn&rsquo;t be merged in with the map. It&rsquo;s ideal to make these into a plugin so that players can choose whether to use them or not &ndash; some players may not like the extra loading time or may prefer chunky 128x128 pixel textures. (Although replacement textures could theoretically be included in a map for another scenario, that would be quite odd &ndash; if you&rsquo;re to the point that you have replacement textures for your map, I&rsquo;d advise making that into a standalone scenario.)</li>
  <li>The <code>&lt;marathon_levels&gt;</code> code excerpt above also shows how to merge in music (i.e., the &lsquo;music file&rsquo; line).</li>
  <li>You can override monster activation limits with MML scripts. If you&rsquo;re making a scenario, override this in your scenario&rsquo;s Scripts folder. The code for this (which also raises some limits on rendered objects) is:
<pre>    &lt;marathon&gt;
      &lt;dynamic_limits&gt;
        &lt;objects value="1024"/&gt;
        &lt;monsters value="512"/&gt;
        &lt;paths value="512"/&gt;
        &lt;projectiles value="256"/&gt;
        &lt;effects value="2048"/&gt;
        &lt;rendered value="1024"/&gt;
        &lt;local_collision value="1024"/&gt;
        &lt;global_collision value="1024"/&gt;
      &lt;/dynamic_limits&gt;
    &lt;/marathon&gt;</pre>
  Alter as needed. By contrast, if mapping for <em>Infinity</em>, you&rsquo;ll probably want to merge in MML, unless you&rsquo;re fine with monsters randomly deactivating when more than twenty are active. See the top of this section for how you should do that.</li>

<h3 id="looper">Looping Music</h3>

<p>For the record, I&rsquo;m not talking about the music restarting after it fades out &ndash; Aleph One does that by default. I&rsquo;m talking about seamless loops, where the ending leads straight back into the beginning. Current releases of Aleph One <em>can</em> do this, but it&rsquo;s very finicky and is dependent upon a few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It doesn&rsquo;t work with MP3 files, only Ogg Vorbis, WAV, and AIFF. The reason for this is that MP3 inserts junk samples at the start and end of a track, and Aleph One&rsquo;s music player doesn&rsquo;t know enough to skip these. Transcoding directly from MP3 to one of these other formats won&rsquo;t help; you&rsquo;ll need to edit the junk samples out and save as another file. If you plan to save your audio as Ogg Vorbis, I recommend following my procedure for upmastering audio on <a href="soundtracks.html#remasterinfo">my soundtracks page</a>; otherwise, you&rsquo;ll experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss">generation loss</a>. (Upmastering does not produce a perfect replica of the sound that got lost during MP3 compression &ndash; that&rsquo;s impossible. If you can find a lossless source, you should definitely use that as the source of your in-game audio. Upmastering does help to counteract generation loss, though.)</li>
  <li>By default, Aleph One parses audio files in 1,024-sample chunks (roughly 23 milliseconds with a 44.1 kHz sample rate) and won&rsquo;t reload the audio file (or load the next file) until it&rsquo;s in the final sample block. Annoyingly, the chunk size can vary based on a setting in the preferences file (and you have to actually load the preferences in a text editor to see the setting), but it&rsquo;s usually 1,024 or 512 (thus, I&rsquo;m oversimplifying here and assuming 1,024-sample blocks).<br /><br />
    
    Thus, in this case, the number of samples modulo 1024 should be as close to 1023 as possible. (You can find out how many samples your music file has in any audio editor worth its salt.) In other words, the ideal number of samples for a loop is <strong>(1024 * <em>n</em>) &ndash; 1</strong>, where <em>n</em> is some integer. It&rsquo;s acceptable for it to be <strong>(1024 * <em>n</em>) &ndash; 2</strong>, <strong>(1024 * <em>n</em>) &ndash; 3</strong>, <strong>(1024 * <em>n</em>) &ndash; 4</strong>, and so on, but the more the distance increases, the longer and more perceptible the delay gets. The longest delay results from <strong>1024 * <em>n</em></strong> samples.<br/ ><br />
    
    Manipulating your song&rsquo;s length by fewer than 23 milliseconds probably won&rsquo;t audibly affect the rhythm if you&rsquo;re careful to fill up the space you add with audio information that isn&rsquo;t out of place (or to trim audio congruously). If silence ends up getting tossed into there, though, you&rsquo;ve got a problem.</li>
  <li>The song must start and end at a zero crossing &ndash; in both channels, in the case of stereo music. A zero crossing is a point where the waveform crosses the midpoint. Here&rsquo;s an example displayed in iZotope RX (zoomed in quite a bit both vertically and horizontally to make it clearly visible).</li>
</ol>

<div class="image"><img src="zerocrossing.png" width="800" height="700" title="Illustration of a zero crossing in iZotope RX" alt="Illustration of a zero crossing in iZotope RX" /></div>

<ol start="4">
  <li>Even this may not be sufficient to get a seamless loop, so I recommend avoiding starting your music file at a particularly loud point. A cymbal crash, for example, is far from ideal. An acoustic guitar strum is better.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tagsareterrible">Tags Are Terrible (though sometimes inexorable)</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; in the right circumstances, they&rsquo;re <em>immensely</em> useful. But they can also break the game if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, especially if they&rsquo;re marked as <strong>Repair</strong>. If you take two things away from this admittedly opinionated section:</p>
  
  <ol><li>Avoid ever marking tag switches or chip insertion slots as <strong>Repair</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you absolutely <em>must</em> mark such a switch as <strong>repair</strong>, make sure it controls <em>both</em> a light <em>and</em> a platform that can <em>always</em> activate <em>or</em> deactivate &ndash; that will <em>probably</em> work around the worst bugs. <em>Probably</em>. (Though you&rsquo;d still be able to deactivate the tag switch, which would make it possible to change a level state from complete to incomplete &ndash; annoying design, to say the least. This aspect, at least, isn&rsquo;t a problem for chips &ndash; once a chip is inserted, it stays inserted.)</li></ol>
  
<p>Now, for the gory details:</p>
  
<ul><li>Tags must be possible to activate when players attempt to activate them. Thus, if a (tag switch/wires/chip slot) controls only something that&rsquo;s controllable by other means and:
  <ul>
    <li>could be active when a player activates the tag and/or</li>
    <li>activates only once,</li>
  </ul>
  that can make a level impossible to complete.</li>
  <li>If a player deactivates a tag switch set to <strong>Repair</strong> and can&rsquo;t reactivate it, they can&rsquo;t finish the mission. Tag switches can&rsquo;t be activated if nothing they control can be activated; rather than risk this, consider never <del>using them</del> marking them as <strong>Repair</strong>. <em>Usually</em> <strong>Repair</strong>-safe:
    <ul><li>Destructible wires (they stay toggled).</li>
      <li>Platform switches (the game remembers they were toggled even if they deactivate).</li>
      <li>Light switches (they can be reactivated unless they&rsquo;re <strong>Destructible</strong> or <strong>Light Dependent</strong>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Chip slots are a &lsquo;maybe&rsquo; on the <strong>Repair</strong> count. Unless set to the &lsquo;dummy&rsquo; tag 0, a chip slot&rsquo;s tag must control something, or it&rsquo;ll consume chips without activating (which also renders levels unbeatable).</li>
  <li>These bugs can interact, as well. If a chip controls a tag that can&rsquo;t activate, it can&rsquo;t toggle the <strong>Repair</strong> mission flag (rendering the level incompletable) and will eat any chips a hapless player tries to insert (possibly rendering future levels incompletable as well, in case a player is meant to have them on said levels).</li>
  <li>Avoid having multiple (chip slots/wires/tag switches) control the same tag.</li>
  <li>If a tag switch controls <em>only</em> lights, it must match the state of at least one of the lights to be able to activate. This means that if you have a tag that controls only a light that starts out active, and the tag switch connected to that light starts out inactive, the tag switch will be impossible to activate. Note that <em>this</em> aspect of tag switch behaviour does not appear to apply to chip insertion &ndash; you will still be able to insert a chip. Confused yet? Good.</li>
  <li>In a previous version of this guide, I wrote,
    <blockquote>&lsquo;If a tag controls a light, it can activate&hellip; probably. Given the absolutely cursed mess I&rsquo;ve detailed above, I&rsquo;m no longer confident that there isn&rsquo;t some <em>other</em> weird edge case with lights that we haven&rsquo;t yet worked out.&rsquo;</blockquote>
    To be fair, I qualified my statement, but we now know at least some of the exceptions. I&rsquo;m not confident that we know them all. The lesson I&rsquo;m drawing from this is that there are probably no universal rules with tags.</li>
  <li>There are also texturing issues (see below) &ndash; in short, if you toggle wires in visual mode, they will get set to not-wires and players will be unable to finish your level. There may be others.</li>
  <li>Basically, tags are awful; you should avoid marking them as &lsquo;<strong>Repair</strong>&rsquo; unless you&rsquo;re <em>completely</em> sure you know what you&rsquo;re doing, and even then, you should be sure you&rsquo;re not falling prey to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. In all cases, I recommend using them with caution.</li></ul>

  <h3 id="waysaroundtags">Ways to Avoid Tags</h3>
    
  <p>Tags aren&rsquo;t always necessary; the main cases where they are necessary are for destructible wires, chip insertion, or very odd arrangements of platforms. In most other cases, a sufficiently determined mapper can avoid using them. Some tips:</p>
  <ul><li>Platforms can activate adjacent platforms when they activate. Or when they deactivate. And they can also deactivate platforms in those same places. Or when fully extended and when fully contracted (&lsquo;<strong>Activates Adjacent at Each Level</strong>&rsquo;).
      <li>Platforms can activate the lights on their floor and ceiling when they activate. They can also deactivate those lights when they deactivate.</li>
      <li>If you have multiple adjoining platforms, it&rsquo;s generally <em>preferable</em> to use a platform switch and set &lsquo;<strong>Activates: Activates Adjacent Platforms</strong>&rsquo; for those platforms &ndash; that way, players won&rsquo;t have to hit a switch twice each time they want to raise or lower the platform.</li>
      <li>If you want to get <em>really</em> adventurous, you can even make underground platform networks to connect otherwise unconnected platforms. Some notes on these:
      <ul>
        <li>Make them extend &lsquo;<strong>From Floor</strong>&rsquo; to reduce the odds of motion glitches, though you may still experience these occasionally.</li>
        <li>These platform networks look ugly in Weland, but players won&rsquo;t see them. If you don&rsquo;t want to see them in the visual mode map either, you can even give them landscape textures. However, avoid doing that on walls that players can see the other side of, or those walls will disappear from the map).</li>
        <li>&lsquo;The Midpoint of Somewhere&rsquo; contains several examples of this. I admittedly went overboard with it, partly to keep players from undoing their progression midlevel (it&rsquo;s already a convoluted enough level) and partly out of sheer stubbornness.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>So, maybe you have a tag switch that you want to use to control your mission state, but you&rsquo;re &ndash; justifiably, given the absolutely cursed mess detailed above &ndash; afraid to actually mark it as &lsquo;<strong>Repair</strong>&rsquo;. What&rsquo;s a mapmaker to do? The most reliable case is probably to have the tag switch control an otherwise inaccessible platform (for the sake of our example, we&rsquo;ll call it Platform 42) that starts out inactive (ideally, just completely inaccessible from the rest of the map), and set one of the walls of Platform 42 as a platform switch that&rsquo;s marked as &lsquo;<strong>Repair</strong>&rsquo;. Then set the tag switch to activate Platform 42. This also means that once you activate the tag switch, the game remembers that the platform switch was activated even if either the platform switch or the tag switch gets deactivated &ndash; thus working around another potential issue with using tag switches as &lsquo;<strong>Repair</strong>&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve shown example settings for Platform 42 below.

      <div class="image"><img src="platform42.png" width="637" height="472" alt="Settings for Platform 42, tag initially inactive" title="Settings for Platform 42, tag initially inactive" /></div>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The tag switch in the above example must start out as &lsquo;<strong>Inactive</strong>&rsquo;. If you need your tag switch to start out as &lsquo;<strong>Active</strong>&rsquo;, connect another platform &ndash; we&rsquo;ll just call it Platform 43 &ndash; to Platform 42 (note that it <em>must</em> share at least one side, and it <em>must not</em> be the side that had the platform switch on it). Start Platform 43 as active, set it to &lsquo;<strong>Deactivates: Never</strong>&rsquo;, make sure &lsquo;<strong>Can&rsquo;t Deactivate Externally</strong>&rsquo; is <em><strong>unchecked</strong></em>, and make sure &lsquo;<strong>Deactivates: Activates Adjacent Platform</strong>&rsquo; is <em><strong>checked</strong></em>. In this example, you&rsquo;ll also want to remove the tag from Platform 42. Here are our settings for Platform 43.
          <div class="image"><img src="platform43.png" width="637" height="472" alt="Settings for Platform 43, tag initially active" title="Settings for Platform 43, tag initially active" /></div>

          <div style="margin-top: 12px;">And here are our revised settings for Platform 42.</div>

          <div class="image"><img src="platform42a.png" width="637" height="472" alt="Settings for Platform 42, tag initially active" title="Settings for Platform 42, tag initially active" /></div>

          <div style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Warning:</strong> I can&rsquo;t promise that either of these solutions are foolproof. If something messes with either platform&rsquo;s activation, it can still break the mission. And there are probably other potential ways to break them as well. I&rsquo;ve used wires, chip insertion switches, and tag switches as repair switches in some of my levels, but I&rsquo;ve also been doing this for some 26 years, and in 2023, I&rsquo;m still learning new things that can break tags. They&rsquo;re even more cursed than platforms, which is saying <em>a lot</em>.</div>

          <div style="margin-top: 8px;">More importantly, given how convoluted all of the above is, I can almost guarantee you&rsquo;ll eventually misremember part of it and more than likely run afoul of one of the many things that can mess up tags. Bearing that in mind, isn&rsquo;t it safer to just avoid using them for repair missions at all? Of course it is.</div></li>

<h2 id="ambientsound">Ambient Sound</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Platforms or doors with associated ambient sounds should have sound objects marked <strong>&lsquo;Is On Platform&rsquo;</strong> so that their &lsquo;moving&rsquo; sounds don&rsquo;t suddenly cut off when players walk off the platform, which sounds unnatural. This doesn&rsquo;t apply to platforms without ambient sounds (i.e., S&rsquo;pht Door, S&rsquo;pht Platform Silent).</li>
  <li>Liquids should have the correct associated sound objects near their edges. Failure to include these causes sudden cutoffs when players move from polygons with liquids to polygons without them (or vice versa). These should be marked <strong>&lsquo;Floats&rsquo;</strong> so they align to their liquids&rsquo; heights; if they fall below the liquids, they&rsquo;ll become almost inaudible, which defeats the purpose of placing them.</li>
  <li>If you place ambient sounds on polygons, boundaries between different ambient sounds (or between ambient sounds and silence) should have sound objects to avoid sudden cutoffs when players move between &lsquo;sound boundaries&rsquo;. This also results in directional sound, which enhances immersion.</li>
  <li>At the same time, avoid overusing sound objects, which eat up map indices worst of all factors that use them: one per polygon within a 10-world unit X/Y radius (Z is irrelevant). If this all sounds like a delicate juggling act, it is! No one said making maps for an ancient engine was <em>easy</em>. I recommend avoiding complicated &lsquo;sound boundaries&rsquo; or too many discrete polygon sounds per level.</li>

<h2 id="texturingissues">Texturing Issues in Visual Mode.lua and Vasara</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you are using a version of Aleph One prior to 1.6:
    <ol>
      <li>Upgrade, for the love of Pthia.</li>
      <li>When you exit visual mode (or type <strong>.save level</strong>), platforms that extend <strong>From Ceiling</strong> or <strong>From Both</strong> should be in the same position they start the level in, or you&rsquo;ll get texture misalignments. Aleph One 1.6 largely fixes this and a related platform alignment bug that occurred even in the original engine. (Slight misalignments &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking a pixel or two &ndash; may still occur if you close the editor while such a platform is moving, but it seems to be entirely fine if the platform is at rest. If such platforms must move continually, one solution is to tie them to some specific action on the map, such as a platform trigger on a player spawn point, and then X+click to set the player start point elsewhere when you go to texture. If you don&rsquo;t set it on the player spawn point, you can also teleport around the map to avoid walking on it. Another solution is reportedly to type <strong>.save level</strong> rather than to close visual mode. Whichever solution you use, you&rsquo;ll need to remember to do it each time you open visual mode.)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>When you exit visual mode, tags should be in the state they&rsquo;re meant to start the level in. Thus, if you tabbed a tag switch that starts the level inactive so you could open some doors, reset the tag to inactive. Take special care with wires and chip insertion switches &ndash; messing them up can render levels uncompletable. For this reason and more (see above), I&rsquo;d recommend avoiding tags where possible.</li>
  <li>Walking on a <strong>Must Be Explored</strong> polygon (or even looking at it if <strong>Exploration (M1)</strong> is set) resets it to <strong>Normal.</strong> Be sure to reset these after texturing (or just don&rsquo;t set them until you&rsquo;ve finished texturing).</li>
  <li>Frame interpolation can cause textures to jitter if you place them without paving first. Some players have also reported that placing textures without first paving can cause crashes (I haven&rsquo;t experienced this). However, paving occasionally crashes Weland (I haven&rsquo;t isolated the cause, but it seems to be an index mismatch), so it&rsquo;s ideal to save, pave, then go into visual mode.</li>
  <li>By necessity, texturing always loads all texture sets, so you may want to avoid using hi-res textures while texturing. If you must use them, I recommend keeping as few other programs open as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vasaratexturing">Further Texturing Issues in Vasara</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Vasara gets weird with more than 56 lights. If you have both &lsquo;Apply Light&rsquo; and &lsquo;Apply Texture&rsquo; selected with a light &#8805; 56, the HUD disappears; reduce the light value to something &lt; 56 and hit the action key to restore it. If one is selected, but not the other, the HUD functions normally.</li>
  <li>If you leave visual mode (or type <strong>.save level</strong>) while a polygon is flashing and highlighted on the map for the player to teleport to, this will be set as a <strong>Major Ouch</strong> polygon and the floor&rsquo;s transfer mode will change to <strong>Static</strong>. So&hellip; don&rsquo;t do that. This occurs because Vasara highlights the polygon on the map by changing it temporarily to a <strong>Major Ouch</strong> polygon (and physically changes its appearance in the game world to create the static effect on its floor).</li> 
</ul>

<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a></p>

<h2 id="m1polygons">Those Weird Marathon 1 Polygon Types</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Superglue</strong>, <strong>Glue Trigger</strong>, and <strong>Glue</strong> only function if <strong>Glue</strong> is selected under <strong>M1 Compatibility</strong> in the <strong>Map Parameters</strong>.</li>
  <li>If <strong>Ouch Is Lava</strong> is selected, monsters won&rsquo;t leave corpses on <strong>Minor Ouch</strong> or <strong>Major Ouch</strong> polygons; however, those polygons will still damage players and monsters even if it isn&rsquo;t.</li>
  <li><strong>Minor Ouch</strong> behaves like <em>M1</em> lava: it only damages monsters and players that are touching the ground.</li>
  <li><strong>Major Ouch</strong> behaves like <em>M1</em> Pfhor goo: it damages monsters and players even if they&rsquo;re airborne.</li>
  <li>Monsters on <strong>Glue</strong> act deaf (but not blind) until players walk onto their polygons (or they&rsquo;re activated by other means). Sounds don&rsquo;t enter Glue polygons but can leave them.</li>
  <li>A <strong>Glue Trigger</strong> activates all monsters that aren&rsquo;t on or beyond Superglue or Zone Borders.</li>
  <li><strong>Superglue</strong> is <em>M1</em>&rsquo;s zone border equivalent; it stops Glue Trigger monster activation (as do Zone Borders).</li>
  <li>If <strong>Exploration (M1)</strong> is selected as a mission type, players must merely look at <strong>Must Be Explored</strong> polygons to complete the mission, rather than walk on them (as in <em>M2</em>/<em>Infinity</em>). As mentioned above, looking at these in visual mode resets them to <strong>&lsquo;Normal&rsquo;</strong>, so be careful.</li>
  <li>If <strong>Repair (M1)</strong> is selected as the mission type (but <em>not</em> regular <strong>Repair</strong>), toggling one repair switch will typically satisfy the <strong>Repair (M1)</strong> mission flag.</li>

<h2 id="circles">Circles and the Custom Grid</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we are taking the term &lsquo;circle&rsquo; to mean &lsquo;regular polygon with sufficiently many sides to look like a circle&rsquo;. Aleph One is not actually capable of curves.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to construct circles in Weland. The simplest is probably to use shift+alt and draw points of equal length out from a central area. This will give you a regular sixteen-sided polygon, and for many cases, this is all you&rsquo;ll need. However, in many cases, you may want more points. There are a few options here. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/circle-plugin-for-weland" target="_blank">circle plugin</a>, which is fine if you&rsquo;re OK doing a bit of math. Another option that doesn&rsquo;t require a plugin (but still requires a bit of math) is the custom grid, this little icon you may not have bothered to try out before:</p>

<div class="image"><img src="gridicon.png" width="647" height="73" alt="Custom Grid Icon" title="Custom Grid Icon"/></div>

<p>When you click it, it brings up some sliders that may at first look intimidating. (I&rsquo;ve resized parts of this image to make its contents legible, but it&rsquo;s otherwise untouched.)</p>

<div class="image"><img src="gridsliders.png" width="740" height="35" alt="Custom Grid Sliders" title="Custom Grid Sliders"/></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reset:</strong> Restores the default grid settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> How much to rotate the grid, from 0&deg; to 90&deg;. (90&deg; isn&rsquo;t quite accurate; I recommend using 0&deg; instead.)</li>
  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> The amount by which to multiply the size of the standard grid, from 0.125 (one-eighth) to 8.</li>
  <li><strong>Origin:</strong> The point around which to center the grid&rsquo;s rotation and scale. This is input using internal units (1,024 IU = 1 WU), so -32,768 (-32 WU) to 32,767 (&asymp;31.999 WU).</li>
  <li><strong>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:</strong> Grid presets. <strong>2</strong> through <strong>6</strong> persist after you quit Weland, apart from the origin point (use them for the grids you use most often); <strong>1</strong> resets when you exit.</li>
  <li>If you select a line, <strong>&lsquo;Reset&rsquo;</strong> becomes <strong>&lsquo;Set All&rsquo;</strong>, which sets the <strong>Rotation</strong>, <strong>Scale</strong>, and <strong>Origin</strong> to match, respectively, the line&rsquo;s angle, its length (give or take an internal unit), and its origin point (i.e., the first point drawn); likewise,
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking <strong>&lsquo;Set&rsquo;</strong> for <strong>&lsquo;Rotation&rsquo;</strong> matches the line&rsquo;s angle.</li>
      <li>Clicking <strong>&lsquo;Set&rsquo;</strong> for <strong>&lsquo;Scale&rsquo;</strong> matches the line&rsquo;s length (again, give or take an internal unit).</li>
      <li>Clicking <strong>&lsquo;Set&rsquo;</strong> for <strong>&lsquo;Origin&rsquo;</strong> matches the line&rsquo;s origin point.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Similarly, clicking <strong>&lsquo;Set&rsquo;</strong> with a point selected sets the point as the origin.</li>
  <li>Therefore, if you need to set a custom <strong>Origin</strong>, make sure you have neither a line nor a point selected; if you need to set a custom <strong>Rotation</strong> or <strong>Scale</strong>, make sure you don&rsquo;t have a line selected.</ul>

<p>For our &lsquo;circle&rsquo;, <strong>Origin</strong> will match its center and <strong>Scale</strong> will match its radius (at its vertices, anyhow). <strong>Rotation</strong> will vary, as we&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how to draw a 24-sided circle. We&rsquo;ll leave Origin as 0, 0. We&rsquo;ll start <strong>Rotation</strong> from 0&deg;. For <strong>Scale</strong>, we&rsquo;ll use the seemingly random number 3.831. Press 4 on the keyboard to get the grid to show at 1x size, then draw points out from (0, 0) in all four cardinal directions. We should have something like:</p>

<div class="image"><img src="circle0.png" width="550" height="546" alt="0&deg; Circle Vertices" title="0&deg; Circle Vertices"/></div>

<blockquote><strong>Protip:</strong> If you&rsquo;re having trouble finding (0, 0), you can rotate the grid forward and backward (it always rotates around the center point); or edit one point by double-clicking it; or start from 15&deg; and work back around to 0&deg;. (I don&rsquo;t recommend using a <strong>Rotation</strong> of 90&deg;; it&rsquo;s not quite accurate.)</blockquote>

<p>From here, we must rotate the grid by regular increments (this might be the trickiest part). 360&deg; (the span of a circle) divided by 24 points (the number of vertices we&rsquo;re using) gives us 15&deg; increments, so our next angle is 15&deg;. Set <strong>Rotation</strong> to 15&deg; and draw lines out from the center. Rotating by another 15&deg; gives us 30&deg;, then 45&deg;, then 60&deg;, then 75&deg;. (We could do this with fewer rotations, but we&rsquo;ll save that for later.) All these steps are shown below.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="circle1.png" width="124" height="124" alt="15&deg; Circle Vertices" title="15&deg; Circle Vertices"/>
<img src="circle2.png" width="124" height="124" alt="30&deg; Circle Vertices" title="30&deg; Circle Vertices"/>
<img src="circle3.png" width="124" height="124" alt="45&deg; Circle Vertices" title="45&deg; Circle Vertices"/>
<img src="circle4.png" width="124" height="124" alt="60&deg; Circle Vertices" title="60&deg; Circle Vertices"/>
<img src="circle5.png" width="124" height="124" alt="75&deg; Circle Vertices" title="75&deg; Circle Vertices"/></div>

<p>We now have our circle&rsquo;s points. Our next step is to draw our lines. It&rsquo;ll probably help to disable the grid or to reduce the grid size (i.e., press 1 on the keyboard).</p>

<div class="image"><img src="circle6.png" width="248" height="248" alt="Drawing the Lines of Our &lsquo;Circle&rsquo;"/></div>

<p>The next task is to fill the circle (assuming we wish to do that). It&rsquo;s an inefficient allocation of map indices to fill all 24 triangles when we can use more sides per polygon; here, we can divide our circle into quadrants to get eight sides per polygon, which is perfect.</p>

<div class="image"><img src="circle7.png" width="248" height="248" alt="Filling Our &lsquo;Circle&rsquo;"/></div>

<p>Now, some notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If we select one of our circle&rsquo;s outer lines, we&rsquo;ll see why 3.831 was our <strong>Scale</strong>: they&rsquo;re all 1 or 0.999 WU long. A long list of radii and rotations that produce 1 WU-long sides can be found below.</li>
  <li>Not using the center as one of our vertices could, in some cases, allow us to fill our circle with fewer polygons; however, it could also result in acute angles, which often cause bouncy walls. In this specific case, four polygons is the fewest we could get away with.</li>
  <li>I mentioned Shift+Alt constraint as a way to create 16-sided polygons. You can combine this with grid rotation if the number of sides is a multiple of 8 (divides evenly into 45&deg;, i.e., use 8 of the 16 Shift+Alt angles) or 16 (divides evenly into 22.5&deg;; i.e., use all 16 Shift+Alt angles). As the math might confuse people at first, I avoided showing this above, but it can save time once you&rsquo;re comfortable with this method.</li>
  <li>Points may be off by an internal unit (&asymp;.001 WU) or two. Adjust them manually if this bothers you. Drawing our lines from the center with Shift+Alt constraint makes this slightly less likely.</li>
  <li>Since we started at 0&deg;, we don&rsquo;t have any horizontal or vertical lines in our circle. To get them, we&rsquo;d divide our grid rotation of 15&deg; by 2 for a starting angle of 7.5&deg;, then increase that by 15 (i.e., 22.5&deg;, 37.5&deg;, 52.5&deg;, 67.5&deg;, 82.5&deg;). The result is below. Note that getting both horizontal and vertical lines requires a number of sides divisible by 4. If it&rsquo;s divisible by 2, we&rsquo;ll get one but not the other. If it&rsquo;s an odd number, we&rsquo;ll get only a single horizontal or vertical side.</li>
<p class="centred"><img src="circle8.png" width="247" height="246" alt="&lsquo;Circle&rsquo; with Vertical Lines"/></p>
  <li>If our number of vertices is not a multiple of four, we&rsquo;ll need to start at 0&deg; as usual, keep adding our angle increment until we exceed 90&deg;, subtract 90&deg; from our <strong>Rotation</strong>, and then continue as before. We also won&rsquo;t draw lines in all four directions &ndash; we&rsquo;ll either draw them in two directions (if our number of vertices is a multiple of 2) or one (if it isn&rsquo;t).</ol>

<h3 id="radii">Radii and Rotations for 1 WU-long Sides with Regular Polygons</h3>

<p >These radii and rotations will create 1 WU-long sides. (As pointless as including a triangle may seem, this is a fast way to get an equilateral triangle centered around a desired point.) <em>Italic numbers</em> are divisible by 8 (i.e, you can use shift+alt with 45&deg; angles); <strong>bold numbers</strong>, by 16 (22.5&deg; angles). 1 WU = 1,024 Internal Units; these are included for the circle plugin. It produces slightly different results, so they differ slightly.</p>

<h2 id="mapcomplexity">Map Complexity: A Case Study</h2>

<p>I mentioned above in <strong>General Notes</strong> that map indices are the primary limit on map complexity, and advised avoiding too many small polygons in a given area. Two more reasons to avoid too much complexity, though, are to avoid frustration and to improve map performance. This case study largely centers on the once-infamous <em>Eternal</em> level <strong>&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo;</strong>. I apologize in advance for the length and number of images; the main lessons can be summarized as &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t overuse greeble or sound objects,&rsquo; but I think illustrating what that means would be helpful.</p>

<p>This is a Weland view of <em>Eternal Mark V</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Draw Mode" src="wghf-mv-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Draw Mode"></div>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve hidden all objects besides players and sounds; they&rsquo;re the only important objects for our purposes.)</p>

<p>And here are some Vasara screenshots, with a few major caveats. First, I took these screenshots with 1.3 shapes because I wanted consistency between them. Second, the map had basically no shading to speak of, so I ran Auto Shade on it to make it easier to parse. Third, I rarely use hi-res textures when texturing, due partly to loading times, but mostly to memory usage: the game must load all textures into memory when it loads Vasara or Visual Mode.lua. That adds up fast. That said, the <em>Mark V</em> version looks like this:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Visual Mode #1" src="wghf-mv-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Visual Mode #2" src="wghf-mv-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; Mark V Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>Beyond the obvious issues of the terrible shading and the sea of gray, this version, despite featuring only 509 polygons, is relatively slow for several reasons I&rsquo;ll discuss at length soon.</p>

<p><em>Eternal X</em> 1.0 overhauled the level, but the new version was even slower. It looked like this in Weland:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Draw Mode" src="wghf-10-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Draw Mode"></div>

<p>Despite only featuring 836 polygons, this one chugs even worse. Both of these maps have a major problem: they have essentially no negative space. To oversimplify slightly, Aleph One is effectively a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_rendering" target="_blank">portal engine</a>. Portal engines have several strengths, but rendering large, complex outdoor spaces is not one of them. As a result, whenever the player gets near one of the edges of one of these maps, the performance plummets, even on modern boxes. With frame interpolation now a feature in Aleph One, it&rsquo;s simply not acceptable for maps to get fewer than 60 fps on modern boxes, at least in areas of the map players are meant to access. Here are a few screenshots of what the 1.0 version looks like (again with 1.3 textures):</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Visual Mode #1" src="wghf-10-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Visual Mode #2" src="wghf-10-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.0 Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>You get as close to the feeling of having climbed up a huge mountain as Aleph One is likely to provide, but as you can see in the first screenshot, the frame rate is bad in places, the texturing is quite dull, and the lamps just look silly. Subsequent releases of the map fixed the latter two aspects, but the frame rate problem persisted, which was the primary impetus for CryoS and me to remake it from scratch.</p>

<p>Our new version &ndash; and I&rsquo;ll withhold its polygon count for a moment &ndash; looks like this in Weland (minus some map writing that I&rsquo;ve removed to make the screenshot more legible):</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Draw Mode" src="wghf-13-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Draw Mode"></div>

<p>This screenshot has some conspicuous features. First, the new map is a lot more circular. (I worked on the design, to the surprise of no one who knows my style.) Secondly, there are <span id="ftnt_ref2" class="dotted" title="One of the crossbeams has gone out of skew on the treadle.">crossbeams<a href="#ftnt2">&#8317;&sup2;&#8318;</a></span> extending through playable areas of the map that break it up into sextants (septants if we count the central structure). It&rsquo;s hard to tell from a Weland screenshot, but these actually create an optical illusion to make players think they&rsquo;re seeing much further than they actually are; landscape textures mostly conceal players&rsquo; inability to actually see past the crossbeams. Here are some screenshots I took in Vasara:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Visual Mode #1" src="wghf-13-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Visual Mode #2" src="wghf-13-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>Again, we notice a few things immediately. First, this area still <em>looks</em> wide-open, even though it constricts the view to a much smaller area; second, despite having a snow script (which can be a drag on performance), the map gets a much better frame rate. And here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll note its polygon count: 2,028 (that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> a typo).</p>

<p>But doesn&rsquo;t it look like you can see over the crossbeams? Yes. This <del>trick</del> <em>illusion</em> employs &lsquo;5D space&rsquo;, the engine&rsquo;s ability to overlap spaces in X/Y/Z coordinates. It can do this because it uses four dimensions to render spaces: X, Y, Z, and polygon. This is related to it being a portal engine: it determines what to render based on how lines connect polygons. I feel a bit like a magician revealing how to perform <del>a trick</del> <em>an illusion</em> here, but&hellip; if you could get to the area of the crossbeam with the blue pillars, you&rsquo;d see this:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #1" src="wghf-13-3.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #1"></div>

<p>And the other side of the crossbeam would look like this:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #2" src="wghf-13-4.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #2"></div>

<p>The only thing to the left of the last screenshot, and to the right of the one prior, is a landscape-textured wall. (These regions are, of course, inaccessible to players.) As long as we constrict players&rsquo; view to a reasonable segment of the level, the frame rate rarely dips below 120 fps and almost never below 60.</p>

<p>But in a few cases, players can actually escape the constriction. One is if they fall to their deaths, which, who cares. In a few others, though, they can use the assault rifle (or a similar weapon) to boost themselves over onto the edges of the crossbeams, whence they&rsquo;ll get a clear view of two sextants at once:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #3" src="wghf-13-5.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Crossbeam Top #3"></div>

<p>Or even jump to an island, where they can see the sky texture clipping their view of the crossbeam in places:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Island View" src="wghf-13-6.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3 Island View"></div>

<p>I consider these secrets, so I don&rsquo;t really care to fix them. More importantly, this goes to show how important negative space is to keeping the frame rate within acceptable bounds.</p>

<p>There are other seams in the level design as well, but there&rsquo;s usually enough going on in the level to distract players from noticing. Another case relates to the blue pillars. Two are clearly visible from here:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3: Now you see it&hellip;" src="wghf-13-7.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3: Now you see it&hellip;"></div>

<p>However, if we step a bit to the left:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3:&hellip;now you don&rsquo;t." src="wghf-13-8.png" width="600" height="300" title="Where Giants Have Fallen 1.3: &hellip;now you don&rsquo;t."></div>

<p>The rear one disappears. This is a result of the engine&rsquo;s lack of any sort of &lsquo;bridges and balconies&rsquo;, owing to how it connects polygons. We can&rsquo;t stack one polygon on top of another, and the passage under the crossbeam blocks off the view above it, so the blue pillar in the back is impossible to show. Despite this, I felt the blue pillars were worth including, since they conceal more conspicuous blemishes in the view from the top of the level (which are again consequences of the passages beneath the crossbeams).</p>

<p>This is the largest map I&rsquo;ve constructed (mostly) from scratch that never once exceeded the map index limit. There are a few reasons for this, but I think the two biggest are ambient sounds and greeble.</p>

<p>Greeble, in this case, refers to map detailing. This may not be evident to anyone else but me, but the newest &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; was effectively my second attempt to make a pastiche of <em>Phoenix</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo;, in this case combining its style with those of <em>Apotheosis X</em> (hence all the hexagons, though I already felt obligated to use them due to Tacticus&rsquo; brilliant sky texture), <em>Eternal</em> itself, and of course my own compulsion to make everything as circular as possible. (Ironically, the one part I didn&rsquo;t create from scratch is the central structure, the most circular part of the whole level &ndash; that was CryoS&rsquo; work.)</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Draw Mode" src="igs-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; 1.3 Draw Mode"></div>

<p>My first pastiche of &lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo;, seen above in its current, unfinished state (1,763 polygons), went a lot differently. It&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; (after a brilliant Corbucci spaghetti western with an equally brilliant Morricone soundtrack); it&rsquo;s from a project that, as of this writing, still hasn&rsquo;t been released: <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>. There are obvious stylistic differences; besides the mathematical regularity of &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo;, we can also see how much more densely the sound, points, and polygons are clustered in many areas (and, as a direct consequence, how much less densely they are clustered in others).</p>

<p>In fact, I first ran out of map indices at around 1,500 polygons and had to prune dozens of sound objects. This is partly because I was pastiching two brilliant mapmakers: <strong>RyokoTK</strong> and my co-conspirator <strong>James Hastings-Trew</strong>, who both tend to employ a lot of greeble. However, I greatly exceeded the amount they use, reasoning, &lsquo;Modern computers can handle it.&rsquo; (This was before Aleph One had frame interpolation.) But thanks to the snow script and the comparative lack of negative space, the map chugs in a few places:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #1" src="igs-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #2" src="igs-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>My further revisions will require me to fix that, which in turn will likely require removing a few parts and reconstructing them from scratch &ndash; a painful process.</p>

<p>It might be more instructive to show screenshots of these maps consecutively:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #3" src="igs-3.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Visual Mode #3"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.3 Visual Mode #9" src="wghf-13-9.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; 1.3 Visual Mode #9"></div>

<p>Now, do I think the geometry in the <em>Tempus</em> map looks cool? Yes. Do I think it looks that much cooler than the <em>Eternal</em> map? Certainly not enough to justify the added difficulty it caused me.</p>

<p>In any case, my main point in showing these screenshots isn&rsquo;t to show off the maps; it&rsquo;s to show how overusing greeble causes problems. It looks cool, but you have to know when to stop. There&rsquo;s probably no way to learn this except trial and error, but I urge you to examine mapmakers&rsquo; styles closely. Ryoko doesn&rsquo;t really use as much greeble as I thought he did when I made &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo;. As an example, &lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; from <em>Starlight</em>, which I believe has the highest polygon count of any map he&rsquo;s released (1,843):</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Draw Mode" src="monument-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Draw Mode"></div>

<p>Yes, there are parts with plenty of greeble, but there&rsquo;s really nothing approaching the density I was using. Regardless of this, when I got his permission to adapt it for <em>Chronicles</em> as a solo level, he warned me that it was near the map index limit, that he&rsquo;d had to simplify it during construction, and that it&rsquo;d probably crash if I added too much complexity or many more ambient sound objects &ndash; which, in fact, is exactly what happened. In any case, here are two views from the southeast of &lsquo;Monument&rsquo; (which, to be clear, is just about the upper bound of the detail I&rsquo;d suggest trying to incorporate):</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Visual Mode #1" src="monument-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Visual Mode #2" src="monument-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Monument to All Your Sins&rsquo; Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>There are parts with a lot of greeble, but others with almost none. And it looks fantastic. This was a lesson I hadn&rsquo;t absorbed when I made &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo;, but &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; hammered it home for me.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m at it, here&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo;, which has 1,771 polygons. The Weland view looks like this:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Draw Mode" src="stp-0.png" width="512" height="512" title="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Draw Mode"></div>

<p>I think the overall polygon density of the map is comparable to what I was trying to accomplish with &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo;, but there are some important differences. The clusters of small polygons aren&rsquo;t as densely packed together, and while there are a lot of sound objects, Ryoko has few of them near polygon clusters as dense as mine. (Scroll back to the &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; Weland screenshot again and look at how densely clustered the polygons in some of my houses are.)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; looks like this in Vasara:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Visual Mode #1" src="stp-1.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Visual Mode #1"></div>

<div class="image"><img alt="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Visual Mode #2" src="stp-2.png" width="600" height="300" title="&lsquo;Stone Temple Pilates&rsquo; Visual Mode #2"></div>

<p>This map slaps. Its influence on &lsquo;Il grande silenzio&rsquo; is probably especially obvious; its influence on &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo; is probably less so, besides the isolated islands from which Enforcers snipe at players, but it&rsquo;s nonetheless there.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to &lsquo;Where Giants Have Fallen&rsquo;. The other way I saved a lot of headache was by using as few sound objects as possible; to avoid using too many, I even went to the trouble of making new ambient sounds that combined existing sounds. For instance, this sound may <em>say</em> <strong>&lsquo;Waterfall&rsquo;</strong>:</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="Sound in Where Giants Have Fallen" src="wghf-13-a.png" width="800" height="416" title="Sound in Where Giants Have Fallen"></div>

<p>However, the following script is merged in with the level:</p>

<pre>&lt;marathon&gt;
    &lt;!-- puts Water &amp; Waterfall into the Waterfall slot --&gt;
    &lt;sounds&gt;
        &lt;ambient index=&quot;6&quot; sound=&quot;251&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/sounds&gt;
    &lt;!-- sets Water to use the Waterfall sound slot --&gt;
    &lt;liquid index=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;sound type=&quot;5&quot; which=&quot;6&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/liquid&gt;
&lt;/marathon&gt;
</pre>

<p>As the comments suggest, this reassigns the &lsquo;Waterfall&rsquo; ambient sound to use a separate ambient sound created by mix-pasting the &lsquo;Water&rsquo; and &lsquo;Waterfall&rsquo; sounds; and it plays that sound whenever the player&rsquo;s head is above water. This effectively cuts in half the number of sounds I need water to play, and cuts the number of sound objects on the level by eight.</p>

<p>On dream versions of the level (of which there are four), I embed another script to combine the &lsquo;Wind&rsquo; sound (or, in one case, the &lsquo;Wind &amp; Rain&rsquo; sound) and the &lsquo;Dream Ambience&rsquo; sound, thus saving further sound objects. The expense is three sound slots and about a dozen megabytes in the sound file (these sounds are CD-quality stereo, so they&rsquo;re not small), but hey, that&rsquo;s nothing by the standards of modern games, and it means the map runs without any issues.</p>

<p>We can boil down the lessons of this case study to two major principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t overuse greeble.</li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t overuse sound objects.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, if I just wrote that &ndash; or even &lsquo;don&rsquo;t overuse greeble and sound objects so you don&rsquo;t run out of map indices&rsquo; &ndash; you might not grasp what &lsquo;overuse&rsquo; means. Hopefully, you at least now have reference points.</p>

<p>An even better understanding can come from looking at <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/starlight" target="_blank">Starlight</a></em>, <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-phoenix-2" target="_blank">Phoenix</a></em>, and the <a href="http://eternal.bungie.org/development" target="_blank">latest preview build of <em>Eternal</em></a> (and <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>, once it comes out) yourself. Learning from others is one of the best ways to improve. <strong>RyokoTK</strong>&rsquo;s other works (<em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/kindred-spirits" target="_blank">Kindred Spirits</a></em>, <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/paradise-lost" target="_blank">Paradise Lost</a></em>, <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/second-quest" target="_blank">Second Quest</a></em>, etc.) are also well worth looking at, as are the works of mappers like <strong>windbreaker</strong> (<em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/imperium" target="_blank">Imperium</a></em>, <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/infra-apogee" target="_blank">Infra Apogee</a></em>, <em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/caustic-dystopia" target="_blank">Caustic Dystopia</a></em>, etc.); <strong>James Hastings-Trew</strong> and <strong>Borzz</strong> (<em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/megiddo-game" target="_blank">Megiddo Game</a></em>, <em><a href="http://nardo.bungie.org/alephone.php" target="_blank">Tempus Irae</a></em>, etc.); <strong>hypersleep</strong> and <strong>CryoS</strong> (<em><a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/apotheosis-x-5" target="_blank">Apotheosis X</a></em>); and of course <strong>Bungie</strong> and <strong>Double Aught</strong> themselves. It&rsquo;s worth not just marveling at the pretty sights, but also closely considering where they use greeble and sounds and &ndash; just as importantly &ndash; where they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h1 id="sounds">Sounds</h1>
<h2 id="sounds-general">General Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds have two different numbers associated with them: sound ID and sound number. Sound IDs can be anything from 130 to 32760, must be multiples of 5, and must be unique within the sound file. If the ID is -1, the game won&rsquo;t play them. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re in no logical order in the vanilla sound file, so I&rsquo;ve listed them all below. The vanilla <em>Infinity</em> sounds only use IDs between 10,000 and 19,210 (inclusive).</li>
  <li>You can use up to 256 classes (sound numbers 0-255); Aleph One&rsquo;s developers advise against using more.</li>
  <li>&lsquo;Volume&rsquo; affects not the sound&rsquo;s decibel level in-game but how far away it&rsquo;s audible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="soundids">Vanilla <em>Infinity</em> Sound ID List</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used the Lua mnemonics for these unless I had a reason not to, which I usually note in tooltips (also reproduced at the bottom of this document as endnotes). Parenthetical names are alternate names prominently used elsewhere (e.g., Anvil/ShapeFusion or Forge/Weland).</p>

<p>Sounds in <strong>bold</strong> below have all of their sources definitively identified (see <a href="#soundsources">Sound Sources</a> below for these). Sounds in <em>italics</em> have some of them definitively identified.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll thus need to change their IDs if you add sounds to them; likewise with all new classes you create.</p>

<h2 id="soundsources">Sound Sources</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been able to locate the sources of many vanilla <em>Marathon Infinity</em> sounds; others remain elusive. Nearly all the ones I&rsquo;ve found are from the <a href="https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/42/The-Original-General-Series-6000-Sound-Effect-Library" target="_blank">General Series 6000</a>, a 40-disc collection by the Canadian company Sound Ideas. (Alternatively, see <a href="https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/51/General-Series-6000-Combo" target="_blank">here</a> for a bundle of the General Series 6000 with, as of this writing, ten extensions, all of which are too recent to be sources for <em>Marathon</em>.) The one exception I&rsquo;ve been able to locate, <strong>Fist Hitting</strong>, comes from the <a href="https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/414/Series-4000-Hollywood-Sound-Effects-Library" target="_blank">Series 4000 Hollywood</a> collection. The Series 6000 sounds are ubiquitous not just in games (<em>Doom</em> also used many of them, for example) but across all types of media, so while you may be hearing shout-outs to <em>Marathon</em> when someone uses one of these sounds, it&rsquo;s likelier that they just used an industry-standard stock sound library.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve remixed or remastered the entire <em>Infinity</em> sound file, using the original sources when I&rsquo;d found them and various audio tricks I&rsquo;ve learned over the years when I hadn&rsquo;t; a recent revision is available <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669769856974979093/1002772642501251142/Sounds_remixed.zip">here</a> (see <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669769856974979093/1002772642845171742/Infinity_sounds_extra_info.txt">here</a> for detailed notes). Do note I keep updating it each time I locate a new source, and that&rsquo;s probably not the absolute latest revision. I&rsquo;ll try to remember to add a link to the most recent revision the next time I upload one.</p>

<p>The sources I&rsquo;ve been able to locate are, in order by disc/track/index:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fist Landing:</strong> Face Punch, Arm Swing and Jaw Sock (4003 track 50, index 2 &ndash; this is the one from Series 4000)</li>
  <li><strong>Lh&rsquo;owon Loon:</strong> Common Loon (6003 track 19, indices 1, 2, and 4; 4 was sped up) with echo removed</li>
  <li><strong>Tick Chatter</strong>, <strong>Fighter Scream</strong>, and <strong>F&rsquo;lickta Death</strong> are all taken from Porcupine (6003 track 94). Fighter Scream is shifted down an octave (twelve semitones) and slowed from about 100 to about 77 bpm. F&rsquo;lickta Death is shifted down an octave and a half (nineteen semitones) and slowed from 100 to 60 bpm.</li>
  <li><strong>F&rsquo;lickta Lava Impact</strong> and <strong>S&rsquo;pht&rsquo;Kr Being Hit</strong>: Small Burst of Flames in Wood Stove (6015 track 20, index 3, excerpt). The latter is reversed and twice as fast (but the same pitch).</li>
  <li><strong>Flamethrower</strong>: Flamethrower Long Burst (6015 track 23, index 1, excerpt)</li>
  <li><strong>F&rsquo;lickta Lava Flyby</strong>: Short, Large Burst of Flame (6015 track 26. I can&rsquo;t recall the index, but it&rsquo;s sped up)</li>
  <li><strong>S&rsquo;pht&rsquo;Kr Attack</strong>: Fireball Impact and Large Fire Burst (6015 track 28, excerpt)</li>
  <li><strong>Transformer</strong>: Electric Transformer Hum (6018 track 39, index 2)</li>
  <li><strong>S&rsquo;pht Platform</strong>: Passenger elevator (6018 track 42, index 4). The <strong>Marathon Platform</strong> is a different edit of the same sound. Bungie also mined a later part of the same sample for the <strong>Energy Recharger</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bullet Hitting Flesh</strong>: Horror Axe Chop, Human (6018 track 80, indices 1, 2, and 3, excerpts)</li>
  <li><strong>Body Falling</strong>: probably Horror Blood Splat, Human (6018 track 82, index 1, excerpt), pitch-shifted down about three semitones</li>
  <li><strong>F&rsquo;lickta Melee Hit</strong>: Horror Head Crunch, Human (6018 track 87, indices 1 and 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Crushed Under Platform</strong>: probably Horror Head Crunch, Human (6018 track 87, either index 3 or 4, possibly pitch-shifted or slowed down)</li>
  <li><strong>Wasp Glob Impact</strong>: probably Horror Head Crunch, Human (6018 track 88, index 1, maybe pitch-shifted)</li>
  <li><strong>Switch On/Off</strong>: Small Breaker Switch (6021 track 44, indices 1/2)</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Binder</strong>: Binder (6022 track 3)</li>
  <li><strong>Light Machinery</strong>: Compressor (6022 track 5)</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy Machinery</strong>: Wahlenberg cutter (6022 track 11)</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy S&rsquo;pht Platform</strong>: Electric Hydraulic Machine (6022 track 18)</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Bookpress</strong>: Book Press (6022 track 25)</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Puncher</strong>: Auto Plant Punch Press (6022 track 36)</li>
  <li><strong>Pfhor Door</strong>: Clothes Cleaning Plant Steam Release (6023 track 5). They reversed one of these to get the opening sound (mislabeled as the closing sound in most lists of sounds)</li>
  <li><strong>Pfhor Platform</strong>: Clothes Cleaning Plant Steam Supply Generator (6023 track 6; the <strong>Oxygen Recharger</strong> may also come from this track, but it&rsquo;s such a short sample that it&rsquo;s hard to be sure)</li>
  <li><strong>Magnum Firing</strong>: .44 Magnum (6025 track 6; index 2 is definitely one source, if not both; they may have used each channel for one of the sounds, or may have excerpted a later index to make the other sound)</li>
  <li><strong>Grenade Launcher Firing</strong>: Anti-tank 20mm (6025 track 25, probably index 1 or 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Bullet Ricochet</strong>: Gun Ricochet, Single Shot, Bullet (6025 track 28, probably indices 1 and 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Rocket Exploding</strong>: Tank Howitzer (6025 track 31, index 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Shotgun Firing</strong>: Tank Howitzer (6025 track 31, index 4; they used each channel to make one sound)</li>
  <li><strong>Cyborg Firing</strong>: Small Grenade Blast (6025 track 55, index 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Cyborg Projectile Hit</strong>: May be a pitch-shifted version of Small Grenade Blast (6025 track 55, index 3). The game doesn&rsquo;t actually use this sound; cyborgs may have used different projectiles earlier in development</li>
  <li><strong>Cyborg Death</strong>: Small Grenade Blast (6025 track 55, indices 1-3) &amp; High Voltage Electricity Spark (6039 track 61, index 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Surface Explosions</strong>/<strong>Thunder</strong>: Mostly Large Explosions (6025 track 56, various indices, and 6040 track 24, index 2), but they supplemented the first sound with another source I haven&rsquo;t yet found</li>
  <li><strong>You Are It</strong>: Guitar Low Note, Bend Down (6027 track 33, index 5)</li>
  <li><strong>Got the Ball</strong>: Human Vocal Voice, &ldquo;Play Ball&rdquo;, Male Baseball Umpire (6032 track 41, index 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Jjaro Ship Creak</strong>: One sound comes from Metal Movement and Squeaks (6032 track 58, index 2, excerpt starting about 40 seconds in). I haven&rsquo;t yet found the other</li>
  <li><strong>Large Water Splash</strong>: Rock, Splash into Water (6032 track 92, index 3)</li>
  <li><strong>F&rsquo;lickta Projectile Sewage Hit</strong>: Rock, Fall on Dirt (6032 track 92, index 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Waterfall</strong>: Small Waterfalls (6035 track 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Water</strong>: Water, Lake Waves Coming In, Light (6035 track 7)</li>
  <li><strong>Goo</strong>: Excerpts from Geyser, Underground Rumble, Water Spraying Out (6035 track 38)</li>
  <li><strong>Under Media</strong>: Underwater Diver Jumping into Water, Air Release, Scuba (6035 track 42)</li>
  <li><strong>Wind</strong>: Thunderclap and Rumble (6036 track 6) and Ghost Town Wind (6036 track 49)</li>
  <li><strong>Night Wind</strong>: Eerie Wind (6036 track 46)</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy S&rsquo;pht Door</strong>: Space Door Activate (6037 track 6, index 2) and Spaceship Door (6039 track 24, indices 3 and 4). Still haven&rsquo;t found the &lsquo;Heavy S&rsquo;pht Door Obstructed&rsquo; sound</li>
  <li><strong>Drone Dying</strong> and <strong>Cyborg Hit</strong>: Steam Single Blast (6037 track 15, index 5). <strong>Cyborg Hit</strong> isn&rsquo;t actually used in the game and is a sped-up version of this sample</li>
  <li><strong>Electric Hum</strong>: Electricity, Various Hums from Drone Tube (6038 track 46), pitch-shifted up five semitones. The in-game excerpt may start at approximately 8.107 seconds (357519 samples); I&rsquo;m not 100% sure</li>
  <li><strong>Pfhor Switch On/Off</strong>: Hydraulic Activator (6038 track 58, excerpted). The &lsquo;off&rsquo; sound is slowed down and pitch-shifted down by two semitones</li>
  <li><strong>Enforcer Exploding</strong>: Single Firing of Tank Gun (6038 track 90, probably index 1 but might be 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Pfhor Ship #1</strong>/<strong>Alien Noise 2</strong>: Spaceship Control Room (6039 track 1)</li>
  <li><strong>Jjaro Ship</strong>/<strong>Alien Harmonics</strong>: Alien Spacecraft Interior (6039 track 9)</li>
  <li><strong>Pfhor Ship #1</strong>/<strong>Alien Noise 1</strong>: Spaceship Interior Rumble (6039 track 11)</li>
  <li><strong>Pattern Buffer</strong>: Computer Spaceship Console Beep (6039 track 27, index 2)</li>
  <li><strong>Drone Start Attack</strong>: slightly shortened version of Robot Servo Motor (6039 track 29, index 5)</li>
  <li><strong>Juggernaut Start Attack</strong>: slightly shortened version of Robot Servo Motor (6039 track 31, index 2)</li>

<p>Also, at least two chapter screen sounds come from the Series 6000 General:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Marathon 2</em>, chapter 1</strong>: Thunderclap with Rumble (6039 track 63, index 3)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Marathon 2</em>, chapter 2</strong> (I think): Entity Pass By (6018 track 92)</li>

  <li><strong>Phantasm Attack</strong>/<strong>Dying</strong>: Lion, Roaring (6003 track 88, various indices)</li>
</ul>

<p>And various mods have also mined these sounds, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Tempus Irae</em> &ndash; Blue Jay</strong>: Blue Jay, Single Calls (6003 track 1, index 1&hellip; maybe?)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Tempus Irae</em> &ndash; Owl</strong>: Owl, Calling (6003 track 21, index 2)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Tempus Irae</em> &ndash; Horse Whinny</strong>: Horse, Interior, Whinny (6003 track 65, index 1)</li>
  <li><strong><em>Rubicon</em> &ndash; Alarm</strong>: General Alarm on Aircraft Carrier (6025, track 66, index 1)</li>
  <li><em>Eternal</em> and </span><em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> use several as well; I&rsquo;ll document them eventually.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re aware of any sources of vanilla sounds not listed here, either for <em>Marathon 1</em>, <em>Marathon Infinity</em>, or even <em>Pathways into Darkness</em>, please let me know.</p>

<p>Acknowledgements to <strong>W&rsquo;rkncacnter</strong> on the Discord for pointing out that the <strong>Fighter Dying</strong> sound is a pitch-shift of the Porcupine sound. I had already noticed that the Fighter and F&rsquo;lickta deaths had the same source, but it never occurred to me that the Tick also had the same source.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><h3 id="anvilaliens">Aliens</h3>
      The "Aliens" section of the physics model stores information about all of the moving, thinking, and attacking objects in the game, such as monsters and BOBs.
        <ul>
          <li><strong id="alienappearance">Appearance and Sounds</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The appearance of a character is determined by a graphic collection index, a color table index, and a list of sequence IDs. Select each edit field for more information.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Graphic Collection:</strong> The Graphic Collection must be a number between 0 and 31. It indicates which collection of graphics in the Shapes file will be used to draw this character. To preview the graphics collections, open a Shapes file.</li>
                  <li><strong>Color Table:</strong> The Color Table must be a number between 0 and the number of tables defined for this collection. It indicates which collection of colors will be used to draw this character. To preview the color tables and graphics, open a Shapes file.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sequence IDs:</strong> Each type of character behavior may have a unique Sequence ID to describe the animation that Marathon should play during the character's action. To preview Sequences, open a Shapes file.
                  <li><strong>Hit:</strong> This animation sequence will be played whenever the character takes damage from a projectile. To not display any animation when the character is hit, enter -1.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hard Dying:</strong> This animation sequence will be played whenever the character's vitality falls below 0 due to massive, or explosive, damage. When it completes, the character will become "Dead." To not display a Dying animation, enter -1.</li>
                  <li><strong>Soft Dying:</strong> This animation sequence will be played whenever the character's vitality falls below 0 due to non-explosive damage. When it completes, the character will become "Dead." To not display a Dying animation, enter -1.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hard Dead:</strong> This animation sequence (which typically has only one frame) will be displayed at the location where the character dies (due to massive, or explosive, damage) until the level is cleared. If the character disappears when it dies, enter -1.
                  <li><strong>Soft Dead:</strong> This animation sequence (which typically has only one frame) will be displayed at the location where the character dies (due to non-explosive damage) until the level is cleared. If the character disappears when it dies, enter -1.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stationary:</strong> This sequence will be played whenever the character remains stationary. You may not enter a -1 here.</li>
                  <li><strong>Moving:</strong> This sequence will be played whenever the character moves. You may not enter a -1 here.</li>
                  <li><strong>Teleport In:</strong> This sequence will be played during the teleport-in action of the character. Marathon will add a teleport-in visual effect to the sequence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Teleport Out:</strong>This sequence will be played during the teleport-out action of the character. Marathon will add a teleport-out visual effect to the sequence.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> Not all of the sounds related to a character are stored in the Physics Model; each sequence may optionally contain up to three other sounds. To edit these sounds, open a Shapes file.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Activation:</strong> This sound will be played whenever the character becomes active.</li>
                  <li><strong>Friendly Activation:</strong> This sound will be played when a character friendly to the player decides that the player is no longer friendly and should become dogmeat. <em>[This can also apply if the character turns on a non-player - for instance, a monster marked as Berserker will play this when it goes berserk, regardless of whether it turned on the player specifically. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Clear:</strong> This sound is played when a character can find no more enemies in range. <em>[But only if they are set to teleport out. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Kill:</strong> This sound is played when a character kills a target.</li>
                  <li><strong>Apology:</strong> This sound is played when a character's projectile hits the player.</li>
                  <li><strong>Friendly Fire:</strong> This sound is played when one of the player's projectiles <em>[hits -Ed.]</em> the character.</li>
                  <li><strong>Flaming:</strong> This sound is played when the character dies from damage of type "Flame."</li>
                  <li><strong>Random:</strong> This sound will be played at random times depending on the random sound mask, below.</li>
                  <li><strong>Random Sound Mask:</strong> This value determines how often the character will play its random sound. It is a value between 0 and 31 where each unique power of 2 increases the chance of playing the sound (so linearly increasing probabilities are 1,3,7,15,31)</li>
                  <li><strong>Sound Pitch:</strong> This value will pitch every sound played by the character. Enter 1.0 for normal playback, higher values for higher pitches, and lower values (greater than 0.0) for lower pitches.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong id="aliencombat">Combat Settings:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Attack Frequency:</strong> The attack frequency indicates how often the character will launch an attack (but not how many projectiles will be fired during that attack). The value measures the number of ticks between attacks (where 1 tick = 1/30th of a second).</li>
              <li><strong>Melee Attack:</strong> The character will use its melee attack if it is within the melee attack range of the character and a melee attack exists (note that if the Chooses Weapon Randomly flag is checked the character will choose an attack at random).</li>
              <li><strong>Ranged Attack:</strong> The character will use its ranged attack if it is not within the melee attack range of the character and a ranged attack exists (note that if the Chooses Weapon Randomly flag is checked the character will choose an attack at random).
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Type:</strong> The attack type corresponds to a projectile type (see the Shots section of the model) which will be created when the character attacks.</li>
                  <li><strong>Repetitions:</strong> When the attack is launched, the character will create a number of projectiles equal to the attack repetitions value.</li>
                  <li><strong>Error:</strong> The attack error will be added randomly in plus or minus degrees (out of 512) to each attack launched by the character.</li>
                  <li><strong>Range:</strong> The attack range is the maximum range at which the character will launch the attack, not the maximum range that the projectile may travel (the projectile's maximum range is determined by the projectile record; see the Shots section).</li>
                  <li><strong>Sequence ID:</strong> This sequence will be played during the character's attack; note that this sequence is also where the sound played during the attack is referenced. To review sequences, open a Shapes file.</li>
                  <li><strong>dx:</strong> The dx value will be added to the character's current position in the x-direction (left-to-right) to find the starting location of the attack projectile.</li>
                  <li><strong>dy:</strong> The dy value will be added to the character's current position in the y-direction (front-to-back) to find the starting location of the attack projectile.</li>
                  <li><strong>dz:</strong> The dz value will be added to the character's current position in the z-direction (top-to-bottom) to find the starting location of the attack projectile.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Shrapnel:</strong> If a shrapnel radius and shrapnel type are provided, the character will inflict damage on nearby characters when it dies.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Shrapnel Radius:</strong> The shrapnel radius acts like the area of effect of a projectile. Every character within the radius of the character when it dies will suffer the damage described below.</li>
                  <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> The damage type must be specified so that immunities and weaknesses can be applied to whatever the shrapnel hits. To change immunities and weaknesses, edit the Monsters section of the model.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alien Damage:</strong> If the shrapnel damage is inflicted by the aliens, Marathon needs to know so that it can make the Kindergarten and Easy levels easier, and the Major Damage and Total Carnage levels harder. <em>[The latter part of this is incorrect - Alien damage does not increase above Normal. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Base Damage:</strong> The damage base is the minimum amount of damage that will be applied to the target. A random amount between 0 and the damage random (below) will also be applied.</li>
                  <li><strong>Random Damage:</strong> The damage base (above) is the minimum amount of damage that will be applied to the target. A random amount between 0 and the damage random will also be applied. <em>[As far as I can tell, the game actually adds a random number from 0 to (damage random - 1), inclusive, to the base damage; if damage random is 0, then it just ignores the field. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> The shrapnel damage scale should always be 1.0000, if shrapnel is desired.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Impact Effects:</strong> Impact effects are played when the character suffers damage from a projectile. The melee impact effect is used only for projectiles that have the 'melee' flag set.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Ranged:</strong> When the character is hit by a ranged projectile (that is, any projectile that does not have the 'melee' flag set), this effect, if one is specified, will be played.</li>
                  <li><strong>Melee:</strong> When the character is hit by a melee projectile (that is, any projectile that has the 'melee' flag set), this effect, if one is specified, will be played.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong id="alienphysics">Physical Constants</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> The vitality of the character measures how much damage it can endure before dying. Any projectile, polygon effect, or shrapnel effect that causes damage to the character decreases this value.</li>
              <li><strong>Radius:</strong> The radius of the character measures how narrow a gap in the map it can pass through and need not match the radius of the graphic used to draw it.</li>
              <li><strong>Height:</strong> The height of the character measures how short a window in the map it can pass through and need not match the height of the graphic used to draw.</li>
              <li><strong>Movement:</strong> The constants in this section determine how the character moves around the map.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Characters always move at the same speed <em>[on the same difficulty setting if the alien flag is set; on any difficulty setting if it isn't -Ed.]</em>. Note that to translate a player speed (as in a Physics record) to a character speed, multiply by 512.</li>
                  <li><strong>Terminal Velocity:</strong> The terminal velocity measures the maximum rate at which the character can move through space, as when falling.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> The gravity field measures how quickly the character will fall when it is no longer suspended by its own motion.</li>
                  <li><strong>Min. Ledge Jump:</strong> The minimum ledge jump measures the largest downwards jump that the character will take willingly.</li>
                  <li><strong>Max. Ledge Jump:</strong> The maximum ledge jump measures the large upwards jump that the character can make.</li>
                  <li><strong>External Velocity Scale:</strong> The external velocity scale acts like inertial mass to determine how objects behave near explosions. 0.0 will cause objects to remain at rest after explosions, while 1.0 will make them act like fighters.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hover Height:</strong> If the "Hovers" flag is set (see Behavior Constants), the character will hover at this height when moving.</li>
                  <li><strong>Door Retry Mask:</strong> This field determines how often the character will attempt to open doors. It is a value between 0 and 31 where each unique power of 2 increases the chance of playing the sound (so linearly increasing probabilities are 1,3,7,15,31)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Perception:</strong> The constants in this section determine how well the character can detect and track other characters on the map.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Visual Range:</strong> The visual range is maximum range at which the character can become aware of another character's presence on the map, assuming that the intervening polygons are lit. <em>[This appears to be incorrect. As far as I can tell, the dependent clause should be struck and replaced with "if the character is not invisible." -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Dark Visual Range:</strong> The dark visual range is maximum range at which the character can become aware of another characters presence on the map, if the intervening polygons are not lit. <em>[This also appears to be incorrect. As far as I can tell, the dependent clause should be struck and replaced with "if the character is invisible." Just in case that wasn't obvious based on my previous note. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> Intelligence measures the maximum number of polygons through which the character "keep a lock" on an enemy character and continue to follow and attack it. <em>[Setting this above 8 seems to cause some serious issues. Don't do it. -Ed.]</em></li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li><strong>Carrying Item Type:</strong> When the character dies, if the damage that caused the death was not of type Explosion or Flame, it will create one of the items specified here.</li>
              <li><strong>Contrail Effect:</strong> The contrail effect, if one is specified, will be played at periodical intervals whenever the character is moving. <em>[As far as I can tell, this should read "whenever the character is dying, if the 'delayed hard death' flag is set". -Ed.]</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong id="alienbehavior">Behavior Settings</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Class:</strong> Every character has a "Class" which is used to determine friend and enemy relationships between the character and the other targets on the map.</li>
              <li><strong>Friends:</strong> Any character class that is checked here will be treated as a "Friend." The character will not attack friends and will not attack a friend that accidentally hits it.</li>
              <li><strong>Enemies:</strong> Any character class that is checked here will be treated as an "Enemy." The character will immediately attack enemies and will move to decrease the range to any enemy that it is aware of.</li>
              <li><strong>Flags:</strong> The flags are used to activate a range of useful and interesting behaviors on each character. Some of them require additional numeric fields to be set.
                <ul>
                  <li>The omniscient flag is used internally by Marathon. You cannot change its value. <em>[I have never seen this flag, but it's in the help strings, so I listed it here. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Flies:</strong> If this flag is set, the character can change its height at will instead of staying on the floor.</li>
                  <li><strong>Is Alien:</strong> If this flag is set, Marathon will make this monster tougher on hard difficulty settings and wimpier on easy difficulty settings. <em>[For a complete list of changes, see <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/Changes-Based-on-Difficulty" target="_blank">the Aleph One Wiki</a>. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Major:</strong> Each monster may have a Major and a Minor variant, which Marathon will choose between in order to make a level harder or easier. If this flag is set, the monster is a Major variant.</li>
                  <li><strong>Minor:</strong> Each monster may have a Major and a Minor variant, which Marathon will choose between in order to make a level harder or easier. If this flag is set, the monster is a Minor variant.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cannot Skip:</strong> To make a level easier, Marathon will sometimes "skip" a character (remove it from the level). If the character should never be skipped (i.e. necessary civilians), check this.</li>
                  <li><strong>Floats:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will float at its "hover height" (see Physical Constants) above the floor.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cannot Attack:</strong> If this flag is set, the character cannot launch any attacks. <em>[This does not seem to be strictly true, but the character will only attack sporadically and haphazardly. The &ldquo;disabled juggernauts&rdquo; found in <em ><a href="https://eternal.bungie.org/" target="_blank">Eternal</a></em>&rsquo;s levels &ldquo;Killing the Giants as They Sleep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Second to Last of the Mohicans&rdquo; provide examples of this. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Uses Sniper Ledges:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will stay on a ledge that provides a good vantage point instead of charging into combat with an enemy.</li>
                  <li><strong>Chooses Weapon Randomly:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will choose between its melee and ranged attack randomly instead of consulting the range to the target.</li>
                  <li><strong>Invisible:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will be drawn in a darker shade of its background, making it much harder to see. The amount of invisibility will be equivalent to a Marine with one Invisibility powerup.</li>
                  <li><strong>Subtly Invisible:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will be drawn in almost exactly the same color as its background. The amount of invisibility will be equivalent to a Marine with 2 Invisibility powerups.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kamikaze:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will always attempt to move closer to an enemy and will explode (inflict shrapnel damage) when it reaches one.</li>
                  <li><strong>Berserker:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will move and attack with greater speed and ferocity when it is nearly dead. <em>[It will also attack anything around it, regardless of whether it would ordinarily consider said monsters allies or not. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Enlarged:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will be drawn at 125% of its normal size.</li>
                  <li><strong>Delayed Hard Death:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will not play its hard death sequence until it reaches the ground. <em>[This means that it will play the Soft Dying sequence until it reaches the ground, then the Hard Dying sequence when it hits the ground. Its corpse will use the Hard Dead sequence. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Fires Symmetrically:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will create two projectiles for each attack, symmetrically oriented on either side of its body.</li>
                  <li><strong>Nuclear Hard Death:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will create a special "nuclear explosion" effect when it hits the ground.</li>
                  <li><strong>Can't Fire Backwards:</strong> If this flag is set, the character cannot spin 180 degrees, fire, and then turn back again (it looks bad for big enemies).</li>
                  <li><strong>Die in Flames:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will use the special "dying in flames" sequence indicated in the Appearance section if it dies due to Flame damage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stay with Clear Shot:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will remain stationary and continue firing instead of moving closer to a target when it has a clear shot.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tiny:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will be drawn at 25% of its normal size.</li>
                  <li><strong>Attacks Immediately:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will attack as soon as it teleports into the level rather than waiting for its normal attack delay.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not Afraid of Water:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will enter water polygons as though they were clear.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not Afraid of Sewage:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will enter sewage polygons as though they were clear.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not Afraid of Lava:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will enter lava polygons as though they were clear.</li>
                  <li><strong>Not Afraid of Goo:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will enter goo polygons as though they were clear.</li>
                  <li><strong>Can Teleport Under Liquid:</strong> If this flag is set, the character will be able to teleport into <em>[or out of -Ed.]</em> the game underneath any kind of media.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

      <li><h3 id="anvileffects">Effects</h3>
      The "Effects" section of the physics model stores information about small animated effects, such as explosions and splashes.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Graphic Collection:</strong> The Graphic Collection must be a number between 0 and 31. It indicates which collection of graphics in the Shapes file will be used to draw this effect. To preview the graphics collections, open a Shapes file.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Table:</strong> The Color Table must be a number between 0 and the number of tables defined for this collection. It indicates which collection of colors will be used to draw this effect. To preview the color tables and graphics, open a Shapes file.</li>
          <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> The sequence specified here will be played from the specified graphic collection using the specified color table.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Pitch:</strong> The sounds referenced by the effect's graphic sequence can be scaled up or down by adjusting the sound pitch, here. Choose values greater than 1.0 for high-pitched sounds, or less than 1.0 (but greater than 0.0) for low-pitched sounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Delay:</strong> The delay field is used internally by Marathon. You cannot change its value.</li>
          <li><strong>Delay Sound:</strong> If a delay is specified, you may also specify a delay sound which will be played during the delay.</li>
          <li><strong>End when animation loops:</strong> This box should nearly always be checked. If it is, when the effect's sequence reaches its loop frame, the effect will end. If this box is not checked the sequence will loop indefinitely.</li>
          <li><strong>End when transfer animation loops:</strong> If a special transfer animation is used for the effect (i.e. teleport effects), this box has the same effect as the "end when animation loops" box, above.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Only:</strong> If this box is checked, the effect will not create any visual sequence but will instead only play the sounds associated with the sequence. Note that the effect automatically ends when the sound is played.</li>
          <li><strong>Media effect:</strong> This box must be checked if the effect is a "media effect", that is, an impact effect used when a projectile hits a media polygon layer (like a pool of water).</li>
          <!-- This flag is used internally by Marathon. You should not change it. -->
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h3 id="anvilshots">Shots</h3>
      The "Shots" section of the physics model stores information about objects that are fired by weapons or monsters and that travel until they hit a target.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Graphic Collection:</strong> The Graphic Collection must be a number between 0 and 31. It indicates which collection of graphics in the Shapes file will be used to draw this projectile. Note that 31 is used as a special value for "no graphics".</li>
          <li><strong>Color Table:</strong> The Color Table must be a number between 0 and the number of tables defined for this collection. It indicates which collection of colors will be used to draw this projectile. Note that if no graphic is to appear you should enter the value 7.</li>
          <li><strong>Sequence ID:</strong> The Sequence ID must be the number of a sequence in the graphic collection specified above. It determines which sequence will be used to draw the projectile. To preview sequences, open a Shapes file.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage:</strong> The damage specified here will be applied to whatever target the projectile hits.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> The damage type must be specified so that immunities and weaknesses can be applied to whatever the projectile hits. The damage type is also used to determine the "screen flash" effect when a player is hit.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage Base:</strong> The damage base is the minimum amount of damage that will be applied to the target. A random amount between 0 and the damage random (below) will also be applied.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage Random:</strong> The damage base (above) is the minimum amount of damage that will be applied to the target. A random amount between 0 and the damage random will also be applied. <em>[As far as I can tell, the game actually adds a random number from 0 to (damage random - 1), inclusive, to the base damage; if damage random is 0, then it just ignores the field. -Ed.]</em></li>
          <li><strong>Damage Scale:</strong> The damage scale is nearly always 1.0; Marathon changes the fist damage scale internally when the player is running.</li>
          <li><strong>Alien Damage:</strong> If the projectile is fired by an alien, check this box so Marathon can make the aliens easier on Kindergarten and Easy and harder on Major Damage and Total Carnage. <em>[The latter part of this is incorrect - Alien damage does not increase above Normal. -Ed.]</em></li>
          <li><strong>Flyby Sound:</strong> If a flyby sound is specified, the projectile will play it to any player that the projectile passes close to without hitting.</li>
          <li><strong>Rebound Sound:</strong> If a rebound sound is specified and the "rebounds from floor" box is checked, the rebound sound will be played whenever the projectile bounces off the floor.</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Pitch:</strong> To pitch the sound higher, enter a value greater than 1.0. To pitch the sound lower, enter a value less than 1.0 but greater than 0.0.</li>
          <li><strong>Radius:</strong> The radius of the projectile need not be the same as its graphic. A smaller radius will allow the weapon to pass through a smaller opening in the map.</li>
          <li><strong>Area of Effect:</strong> The damage specified above will be applied to every character within the area of effect of the weapon when it detonates.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The speed field determines how quickly the projectile travels across the map. <em>[The speed is in internal units per game tick. Divide by 1,024 to get world units per game tick; multiply the result by 30 to get world units per second. -Ed.]</em></li>
          <li><strong>Maximum Range:</strong> If the projectile reaches its maximum range without impacting a target, it will disappear. If a maximum range of -1 is specified, the projectile will always travel until it hits a target.</li>
          <li><strong>Detonation Effect:</strong> If a detonation effect is specified, the requested effect will be played at the detonation point when the projectile hits a target. To preview effects, open the Effects section of the model.</li>
          <li><strong>Media Detonation Effect:</strong> The media detonation effect is played when the projectile hits some type of media (e.g. water).</li>
          <li><strong>Contrail:</strong> If ticks between contrails (below) is positive, the contrail effect will be created at the specified interval until the maximum number of controls is created.</li>
          <li><strong>Ticks between contrails:</strong> The contrail effect will be created at the interval specified by this field (where 1 tick = 1/30th of a second).</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum contrails:</strong> If this field is not -1, it will be used as the maximum number of contrails created by the projectile.</li>
          <li><strong>Media impact:</strong> This field may specify a type of projectile that will immediately hit the player if the specified projectile is used under media (i.e. when a fusion gun is fired under water).</li>
          <li><strong>Flags:</strong> The flags are used to activate a range of useful and interesting behaviors on each projectile. Some of them require additional numeric fields to be set.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Guided:</strong> If the guided flag is activated, the projectile will seek out a player if it is fired by a monster. It has no effect for projectiles created by the player.</li>
              <li><strong>Stop when animation loops:</strong> If this box is checked, when the shot's sequence reaches its loop frame, the effect will end. If this box is not checked the sequence will loop until the shot hits a target.</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will stop moving and doing damage when it hits a target, but will not disappear until its sequence completes.</li>
              <li><strong>Alien:</strong> Check this box to inform Marathon that a given shot will only be created by aliens rather than by the player or friendly civilians, so that it can be made easier on lower difficulty settings. <em>[This means that it will be slower on lower difficulties and faster on higher difficulties. Contrast this with Alien Damage, which only reduces damage on easier difficulties and does not increase damage on higher ones. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>Affected by gravity:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will drop under the effects of gravity.</li>
              <li><strong>No horizontal error:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will not suffer any horizontal error when fired (see Error under Weapons, or Alien Attack Definitions).</li>
              <li><strong>No vertical error:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will not suffer any vertical error when fired (see Error under Weapons, or Alien Attack Definitions).</li>
              <li><strong>Can toggle control panels:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot can toggle control panels and flip switches in the map.</li>
              <li><strong>Positive vertical error:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will only have positive (i.e. up) vertical error when fired. This is a useful effect when the shot must appear to come out of the top of the firing character.</li>
              <li><strong>Melee projectile:</strong> If this box is checked, Marathon will use the melee projectile impact effect for the shot's impact results.</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent and virulent:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will continue until reaching its maximum range or a wall, regardless of how many mobile targets it hits until then. <em>[Note that it will change owner each time it hits a target. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>Usually pass transparent side:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will usually, but not always, pass through a polygon edge containing a partially-transparent texture. If it does not pass the edge, it will impact on the transparent edge.</li>
              <li><strong>Sometimes pass transparent side:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will sometimes, but not always, pass through a polygon edge containing a partially-transparent texture. If it does not pass the edge, it will impact on the transparent edge.</li>
              <li><strong>Doubly affected by gravity:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will fall at twice the normal gravity rate. Note that the "affected by gravity" box, above, need not be checked.</li>
              <li><strong>Rebounds from floor:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will rebound from the floor when it hits, unless its forward motion is less than a minimum.</li>
              <li><strong>Penetrates liquids:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will travel freely under any media type (e.g. water, sewage, etc.).</li>
              <li><strong>Becomes item on detonation:</strong> This box is used internally by Marathon for shots that need to be converted to an item when they finish their motion. You cannot change this behavior.</li>
              <li><strong>Bleeding projectile:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will cause the special "ranged impact effect" when it hits a target.</li>
              <li><strong>Horizontal wander:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will suffer random horizontal error perpendicular to the direction of movement.</li>
              <li><strong>Vertical wander:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will suffer random vertical error perpendicular to the direction of movement.</li>
              <li><strong>Affected by half gravity:</strong> If this box is checked, the shot will fall in half-gravity maps.</li>
              <li><strong>Penetrates liquid boundary:</strong> (MInf only) If this box is checked, the shot can pass freely through a media layer (e.g. from underwater to above).</li>

          <li><strong>Max. backward velocity:</strong> Max backward velocity is the maximum speed that the player may move when the backward key is pressed.</li>
          <li><strong>Max. perpendicular velocity</strong>: Max perpendicular velocity is the maximum speed for side-step movement by the player.</li>
          <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> The acceleration field determines how the quickly the player's speed will increase when moving forward, backwards, or side-stepping.</li>
          <li><strong>Deceleration:</strong> The deceleration field determines how quickly the player will come to a stop when a key is pressed to reverse direction.</li>
          <li><strong>Airborne deceleration:</strong> The airborne deceleration field determines how quickly the player will lose forward-backward velocity while airborne.</li>
          <li><strong>Gravitational acceleration:</strong> The gravitational acceleration field determines how quickly the player will accelerate due to gravity. If it is zero, the player can launch himself by firing weapons down. If it is negative, the player will fly off the ground.</li>
          <li><strong>Climbing acceleration:</strong> The climbing acceleration field determines how quickly the player will gain vertical velocity when climbing stairs.</li>
          <li><strong>Terminal velocity:</strong> Terminal velocity is the maximum speed the player may achieve when in free-fall.</li>
          <li><strong>External deceleration:</strong> The external deceleration field determines how quickly the character comes to a stop when a force is exerted on it by another character or effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Angular acceleration:</strong> The angular acceleration field determines how quickly the player can accelerate his angular velocity and therefore how quickly a turn can be started.</li>
          <li><strong>Angular deceleration:</strong> The angular deceleration field determines how quickly the player can stop a turn.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum angular velocity:</strong> The maximum angular velocity is the maximum speed at which the player may turn.</li>
          <li><strong>Angular recentering velocity:</strong> The angular recentering velocity determines how quickly the player stops turning.</li>
          <li><strong>Head angular velocity:</strong> The head angular velocity field determines how quickly a look-left or look-right can be made.</li>
          <li><strong>Head angular maximum:</strong> The head angular maximum field is the maximum number of degrees (out of 512) that the player's head may be turned to the left or right.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximum elevation:</strong> The maximum elevation should always be 42.6666.</li>
          <li><strong>External angular deceleration:</strong> The external angular deceleration determines how quickly the player's turning will come to a stop if an external force prevents it.</li>
          <li><strong>Step delta:</strong> The step delta determines the distance that the player must travel for a complete viewpoint "bounce" to occur.</li>
          <li><strong>Step amplitude:</strong> The step amplitude determines how much the viewpoint "bounces" during steps.</li>
          <li><strong>Radius:</strong> The radius of the player need not be the same size as the player's graphic. A smaller radius will allow the player to fit through smaller openings in the map. <em>[No it won't. This is dependent upon polygon exclusion zones, which are hard-coded at 512 internal units in diameter. -Ed.]</em></li>
          <li><strong>Height:</strong> The height of the player need not be the same size as the player's graphic. A smaller height will allow the player to fit through smaller windows in the map. <em>[This is correct, however. -Ed.]</em></li>
          <li><strong>Dead height:</strong> The dead height field determines the height of the camera when the player is dead and lying on the ground.</li>

          <li><strong>Splash height:</strong> The splash height determines the elevation of the viewpoint that is drawn to the screen when the player has died.</li>
          <li><strong>Half camera separation:</strong> The half-camera separation determines the focal length of the perspective projection. Don't change it unless you know what you're doing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h3 id="anvilweapons">Weapons</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Item Type:</strong> This field establishes the connection between a type of item (that can be in the map) and a weapon class.</li>
              <li><strong>Weapon Class:</strong> Melee weapons always use the melee impact effect. Single function weapons fire the main trigger on both keys. Dual function weapons can "charge" to perform their secondary trigger. Two-fisted weapons can be used two at once. Multipurpose weapons have two separate ammo types.
              <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The constants here determine how the weapon will be drawn when the player is holding it.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Graphic Collection:</strong> The Graphic Collection must be a number between 0 and 31. It indicates which collection of graphics in the Shapes file will be used to draw this weapon. To preview the graphics collections, open a Shapes file.</li>
                  <li><strong>Color Table:</strong> The Color Table must be a number between 0 and the number of tables defined for this collection. It indicates which collection of colors will be used to draw this weapon. To preview the color tables and graphics, open a Shapes file.</li>
                  <li><strong>Idle:</strong> The idle sequence ID will be used to draw the weapon whenever it is not firing, reloading, or charging. <em>[Note that idle sequences using more than one frame are bugged, and I do not recommend using them. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Firing:</strong> The firing sequence ID will be used to draw the weapon while it is firing. Note that the length of the firing sequence determines how quickly the weapon can fire.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reloading:</strong> The reloading sequence ID will be played whenever the weapon reloads its primary trigger. A multipurpose weapon reloading its secondary trigger may not have a custom graphic sequence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Charging:</strong> The charging sequence ID will be played while the weapon is charging. If the charging sequence ID is -1, the normal idle sequence will be used.</li>
                  <li><strong>Charged:</strong> The charged sequence ID will be played while the weapon is charged. Note that the "charged weapon sound" from the secondary trigger will also be played whenever the weapon is charged.</li>
                  <li><strong>Flash Intensity:</strong> The muzzle flash intensity of the weapon is set by this field. Note that the flash will not appear unless the flash decay time (below) is larger than 0.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Idle Height:</strong> The height at which the weapon idles is determined by this field. It is highly dependent on the size and origin of the idle graphic frames and should not be changed unless you are also changing the idle graphic.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bob Amplitude:</strong> The degree of vertical "bob," or movement with the player's steps, that the weapon exhibits, is set here.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kick Height:</strong> The kick height is added to the idle height of the weapon to find the starting position for the "firing" sequence.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reload Height:</strong> The reload height is used to draw the "reloading" sequence. It should not be changed unless you are also changing the reload graphic.</li>
                  <li><strong>Idle Width:</strong> The idle width should nearly always be 0.5; it only requires different values for weapons that are not drawn in the bottom-center of the field.</li>
                  <!--<li><strong>Horizontal Amplitude: </strong>The horizontal amplitude field should always be 0.0.</li>-->

                  <li><strong>Await reload:</strong> The "await reload" time is the number of ticks required after the last shot from a clip is fired before the "reloading" sequence is begun. Once the "reloading" sequence has begun the player cannot change weapons.</li>
                  <li><strong>Loading:</strong> The "loading" time is the number of ticks required to load a new clip into the weapon (either primary or secondary trigger).</li>
                  <li><strong>Finish loading:</strong> The "finish loading" time is the number of ticks required after the clip is loaded before the weapon can be fired again.</li>
                  <!--The powerup time is not used.-->
                  <li><strong>Flash decay time:</strong> The "flash decay time" is the number of ticks during which the weapon's muzzle flash fades. Note that the weapon must have a flash intensity, above, for a muzzle flash to appear.</li>
                  <!--The powerup type is not used.-->
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Flags: </strong> The flags are used to activate a range of useful and interesting behaviors on each weapon. Some of them require additional fields to be set.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Automatic:</strong> If the automatic flag is set, the weapon will continue to fire as long as the firing key is held down. Note that shots will fire only a rapidly as the firing sequence can be played.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disappears after use:</strong> If the disappears after use flag is set, the weapon will disappear when it runs out of ammunition.</li>
                  <li><strong>Plays instant shell casing sound:</strong> If this flag is set, the weapon will play a shell casing sound at the same time as the firing sound.</li>
                  <li><strong>Overloads:</strong> If this flag is set and the weapon's class is "dual-purpose," the weapon will explode if it is charged and not fired within a length of time. <em>[That length of time is apparently one minute. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <li><strong>Random ammo on pickup:</strong> If this flag is set, the weapon will have a random amount of ammunition for its primary trigger when it is picked up. <em>[That amount being based on the primary trigger's rounds per magazine; it can have anywhere from half the number specified to the number specified. -Ed.]</em></li>
                  <!--The powerup is temporary flag is not used.-->
                  <li><strong>Reloads in one hand:</strong> If this flag is set and the weapon's class is "two-fisted," the weapon in the other hand can continue to fire while the first weapon reloads.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fires out of phase:</strong> If this flag is set, the weapon can fire two-handed without waiting for the other hand's animation to complete.</li>
                  <li><strong>Fires under liquids:</strong> If this flag is set, the weapon can produce its projectile under any media type (e.g. water). Note that the projectile must have the "penetrates media" flag set in order to do anything.</li>
                  <li><strong>Triggers share ammo:</strong> If this flag is set, the primary and secondary triggers use the same ammunition value.</li>
                  <li><strong>Angular flapping on 2nd trigger:</strong> If this flag is set, the secondary trigger will introduce an automatic x-axis error to the left or right of the player's target point.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong id="triggersettings">Trigger Settings</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Main/Secondary Triggers:</strong> Whenever a weapon is fired, Marathon will use the information in a trigger record to create the appropriate effect. Note that the secondary trigger information will not be used unless the weapon is a multi-purpose or dual-purpose weapon.</li>
              <li><strong>Projectile:</strong> The type of projectile that will be created when the trigger fires is indicated here. To change projectile statistics, edit the "Shots" section of the model.</li>
              <li><strong>Rounds/magazine:</strong> The number of shots available per clip of ammunition is set here. Note that Marathon may not be able to draw the graphic for remaining ammo if you set this number higher than the default, but that the ammo will still be available.</li>
              <li><strong>Ammo type:</strong> Select the item class that is used to re-arm the trigger here.</li>
              <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> Each trigger may have a custom set of sounds for its behavior set here. Note that unlike many other Marathon behaviors, the graphic sequences are not used to store weapon sounds, as different sounds are needed for each trigger.
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Firing:</strong> This sound will be played whenever the weapon fires.</li>
                  <li><strong>Click:</strong> This sound will be played if the weapon is fired without sufficient ammunition.</li>
                  <li><strong>Charging:</strong> This sound will be played if the weapon is a dual-purpose weapon during the charging time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Shell Casing:</strong> This sound will be played at random intervals when the weapon is fired, if a shell casing graphic is specified.</li>
                  <li><strong>Reloading:</strong> This sound will be played when the trigger reloads.</li>
                  <li><strong>Charged:</strong> This sound will be played periodically when a dual-purpose weapon is charged. It will be played with increasing frequency and pitch as the charge time increases, until the weapon overloads and explodes <em>[if it is set to do so -Ed.]</em>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Ticks/round:</strong> If a value other than -1 is entered here, it will be used as the delay between shots when the weapon fires (in ticks of 1/30th of a second). Note that the minimum time for a weapon to fire is always the time for the weapons firing sequence.</li>
              <li><strong>Recovery Ticks:</strong> The recovery time measures the required number of ticks required after a firing animation completes before the weapon can be fired again.</li>
              <li><strong>Charging Ticks:</strong> If a value other than 0 is entered here, it will be used as the required time to charge the trigger before it can be fired. Note that this should ONLY have a value other than 0 if the weapon is a dual-purpose weapon.</li>
              <li><strong>Recoil Magnitude:</strong> If a value other than 0 is entered here, the player will be pushed backwards with a force proportional to the number entered here when the weapon fires (note that a negative value will pull the character forwards).</li>
              <li><strong>Theta Error:</strong> The firing, or "theta" error, is the maximum error applied to the weapon's aim when it is fired. A higher error will result in a spray of inaccurate fire.</li>
              <li><strong>dx:</strong> The value entered here will be added to the player's location in the x-axis (left to right) when the weapon fires to find the starting location for the projectile.</li>
              <li><strong>dz:</strong> The value entered here will be added to the player's location in the z-axis (front to back) when the weapon fires to find the starting location for the projectile.</li>
              <li><strong>Burst Count:</strong> The burst count is the number of projectiles that will be created every time the weapon is fired. Note that there must be enough ammo loaded in the weapon to create the full number of projectiles.</li>
              <li><strong>Shell casing type:</strong> If the weapon should have a shell-casing animation, select one here. Note that the SMG animation is only available in Marathon Infinity.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h2 id="anvilsounds">Sounds</h2>
  Each Sound may contain up to 5 permutations. You may select the Sound to edit from this menu and then select a permutation from the list box, below.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>8-Bit:</strong> Check this button to listen to and edit the 8-bit (lower-quality, smaller) sounds.</li>
      <li><strong>16-Bit:</strong> Check this button to listen to and edit the 16-bit (high-quality, larger) sounds.</li>
      <li><strong>List Box:</strong> This list box displays a list of the permutations assigned to the current sound, above. You may change or insert new sounds by choosing "Insert Permutation" from the Sounds menu.</li>
      <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> This displays the number of permutations stored in the current sound. You may insert new sounds by selecting "Insert Permutation" from the Sounds menu.
      <!--The Sound Code doesn't seem to do anything.-->
      <li><strong>Volume:</strong> The Volume setting can be used to play the sound more softly, or more loudly, than all other sounds. <em>[This is incorrect. Counter-intuitively, the Volume setting affects how far away the sound is audible, not its in-game volume. -Ed.]</em></li>
      <li><strong>Cannot be restarted:</strong> If the cannot be restarted flag is checked, Marathon will check to see if the sound is already being played before playing it again (i.e. the Bob's voices).</li>
      <!--Does not self-abort flag-->
      <li><strong>Resists pitch changes:</strong> If the resist pitch changes flag is set, the sound will not be pitch-shifted, even if a monster is trying to pitch change all of its sounds.</li>
      <li><strong>Can't change pitch:</strong> If the can't change pitch flag is set, the sound will never change pitch.</li>
      <li><strong>Can't be obstructed:</strong> If the can't be obstructed flag is set, the sound will never be obstructed by walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Can't be media obstructed:</strong> If the can't be media obstructed flag is set, the sound will never be obstructed by media layers.</li>
      <li><strong>Is Ambient:</strong> The is ambient flag must be set for Marathon to save memory by not loading ambient sounds if they are disabled in the Marathon Preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><h2 id="anvilshapes">Shapes</h2>
    <ul>

      <li><h3 id="anvilbitmaps">Bitmaps and Color Tables</h3>
        The Bitmaps fields of a Shape file contain the actual image data for the shapes and the color tables used to draw them. You may insert new shapes or change color tables by changing the Bitmaps records.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Display:</strong> Choose "Bitmaps" from this menu to view and edit the bitmaps for this collection, or "Color Tables" to view and edit the color tables for the collection.</li>
          <li><strong>Bitmaps:</strong> These are the bitmaps stored in the current collection. Click on one of them and choose Paste from the Edit menu to insert a new graphic, or choose "Import PICT" from the Shape menu to load a PICT graphic.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Table:</strong> Choose the color table you want to view the current bitmaps with from this menu.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h3 id="anvilsequences">Frames and Sequences</h3>
      The Sequences fields of a Shape file contain the lists of frames that are used to animate objects during the game and draw them from multiple perspectives. They also contain information about synchronized sounds to be played during the sequences.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sequences:</strong> Frames and Views are organized into Sequences, which is a single action taken by a Marathon character, weapon, or effect. You may edit the sequences here.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Select a graphic collection to edit from this menu. Note that not all of the fields visible in the Sequences editor will apply to all collections (especially walls and landscapes).</li>
              <li><strong>Scale Factor:</strong> If a given sequence does not specify a scale factor, the scale factor given here will be used to scale up the graphics for that collection. <em>[In ShapeFusion, the scale factor must be specified, or it will default to 0 and not display the graphic. Moreover, due to a bug, it sometimes shows you the default scale factor for a new frame for which it hasn't inserted said scale factor. You should always specify this manually when inserting a new frame. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> Select a sequence from the list box to edit it.</li>
              <li><strong>Ticks per frame:</strong> Each frame in the sequence will be displayed for one or more ticks (30ths of a second). You may change the number of ticks here.</li>
              <li><strong>Scale factor (this shape):</strong> If this sequence should have a different scale factor from that of the entire collection, enter it here.</li>
              <li><strong>Transfer Mode:</strong> The Transfer Mode determines how the shape will be drawn to the screen. You may mark a shape as transparent here, for example. Note that to make a monster transparent you should change the transparent flag in the physics model, not the shape mode.</li>
              <li><strong>Transfer mode period:</strong> If the transfer mode requires timing, enter the period (in ticks) for the mode here.</li>
              <li><strong>First frame sound:</strong> If a sound is specified here, it will be played on the first frame of the sequence.</li>
              <li><strong>Key frame sound:</strong> If a sound is specified here, it will be played on a special "key" frame of the sequence. You may set the key frame below.</li>
              <li><strong>Last frame sound:</strong> If a sound is specified here, it will be played on the last frame of the sequence.</li>
              <li><strong># of views:</strong> You may specify 1, 4, 5, or 8 frames for the sequence, depending on whether it should change at 90&deg; (4), 72&deg; (5), or 45&deg; (8) increments, or not at all (1).</li>
              <li><strong>Views in Sequence:</strong> Select a view in the sequence here.</li>
              <li><strong>Frames in View: </strong>Select a frame in the sequence here. Frames will automatically be assigned in consecutive order. <em>[This is not true of ShapeFusion, wherein you can and in fact must assign frames in whatever order you choose. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>Frames/view:</strong> Enter the number of frames per view of the sequence here.</li>
              <li><strong>Loop Frame:</strong> If you enter a loop frame index here, the sequence will loop when the index is reached.</li>
              <li><strong>Key Frame:</strong> Enter a key frame index here to mark when the key frame sound should be played, when damage should be applied, and when monsters should attack.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Frames</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Select a frame from the list here. To create new frames, you must extend the views of a sequence. <em>[This is not true in ShapeFusion, wherein you must create frames independently of sequences. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>X-mirror:</strong> If x-mirroring is activated, the frame will be drawn with left and right reversed.</li>
              <li><strong>Y-mirror:</strong> If y-mirroring is activated, the frame will be drawn with top and bottom reversed.</li>
              <li><strong>Keypoint obscured:</strong> (Used only for torsos and legs:) If the keypoint obscured flag is set, the player's torso will be drawn behind the legs.</li>
              <li><strong>Bitmap Index:</strong> Enter the number of a bitmap here to specify which bitmap the frame should use to draw.</li>
              <li><strong>Min. Light Intensity:</strong> Enter the minimum light intensity required to make a shape visible here. <em>[That is, the frame will always be drawn with at least this light intensity. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>X Origin:</strong> Enter the x-coordinate of the shape origin here. The origin point needs to be held constant between frames of a sequence.</li>
              <li><strong>Y Origin:</strong> Enter the y-coordinate of the shape origin here. The origin point needs to be held constant between frames of a sequence.</li>
              <li><strong>X Keypoint:</strong> Enter the x-coordinate of the shape keypoint here. The keypoint is used only for matching player torsos to legs. <em>[Though Bungie seems to have used it to figure out where to flip X-mirrored shapes as well. -Ed.]</em></li>
              <li><strong>Y Keypoint:</strong> Enter the y-coordinate of the shape keypoint here. The keypoint is used only for matching player torsos to legs.</li>
              <!--The world coordinates are visible only for debugging purposes.-->
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Clone into Collection:</strong> When you "Clone" a collection, all of the bitmaps, color tables, sequences, and frames associated with that collection will be duplicated into the current collection. You may then edit the new collection as you wish. <em>[This functionality does not currently exist in ShapeFusion. -Ed.]</em></li>
    </ul>

(See <a href="#ShapeFusion">reference</a> above.)

<pre># Default names for elements related to ShapeFusion
#
# This file lists names for Infinity-like scenarios, based *largely* on the default Lua
# mnemonics, with exceptions falling into six categories:
#
# 1. Anything in [brackets], usually to clarify:
#     a. stuff I thought might be confusing, or
#     b. to note which sound classes are empty and which are (AFAIK) not used anywhere
#        (these are not always the same).
# 2. Apostrophes, which I added for readability. AFAIK, the only mnemonic that has an
#    apostrophe is "Lh'owon" in the scenery, which ShapeFusion doesn't have names for.
# 3. The scare quotes are also not in the mnemonics. I used these for a few sound names
#    that are incorrect for at least the 16-bit sounds. Unfortunately, the default Lua
#    mnemonics are what they are.
# 4. For collections, I added numbers to the start that aren't part of the mnemonics
#    (no one wants to count collection numbers).
# 5. Numbers at the end of the sound list, so that if you've added sound classes, you
#    can select them in your physics models.
# 6. Tick -> Flappyboi. Clearly the most important change.
