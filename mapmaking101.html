<h1>Marathon Mapmaking: Setup, Snafus, & Solutions</h1>
<h2>Starting Steps</h2>

	<p>This document is a guide to getting started creating content for <strong><a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" target="_blank">Marathon Aleph One</a></strong>, an open-source engine based on <strong>Bungie</strong>&rsquo;s groundbreaking first-person shooter trilogy (<span class="decimal">1994-1996</span>) &ndash; <em>not</em> its upcoming extraction shooter (though I&rsquo;m quite intrigued by the latter). This is primarily an abridgement of a <a href="mapmaking.html">much longer guide</a> I have written that currently isn&rsquo;t broken up into digestible chunks; here, I&rsquo;ve included solely what beginning mapmakers need to know.</p>

	<p>This abridgement contains links to modern editors for Aleph One, a guide to setting up Weland and a visual mode plugin (either Vasara or Visual Mode.lua) in Windows and MacOS (a Linux guide may be forthcoming), links to the first resources you should read and watch once you&rsquo;ve set Weland up, Forge manual errata, descriptions of a few aspects of modern mapmaking that aren&rsquo;t covered by the Forge tutorials, and links to more advanced resources.</p>

	<p>Bungie&rsquo;s two official editors were Forge (mapmaking) and Anvil (physics, shapes, sounds). I won&rsquo;t address how to run these in this guide, because they don&rsquo;t run on any operating system past MacOS 9.2.2, and there are vastly better replacements for both programs that actually run on modern operating systems. The next section, &ldquo;Comparison of Texturing Utilities&rdquo;, may help you decide which visual mode replacement you want.</p>

	<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li><strong>Weland</strong> (most aspects of mapmaking, replaces Forge&rsquo;s overhead view): <a href="https://github.com/treellama/weland/releases" target="_blank">github.com/treellama/weland/releases</a>
		<div style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong><em>Make sure to grab the right dependency for your platform &ndash; the download page is confusingly laid out. I&rsquo;ve written a detailed setup guide; you can find it in &lsquo;Weland Setup&rsquo; under &lsquo;Mapmaking Basics&rsquo;.</em></strong></div></li>
		<li><strong>Vasara</strong> (texturing, more like Windows/MacOS&rsquo; graphical user interfaces; Forge visual mode replacement #1):
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Vasara <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">0</span>.<span class="decimal">3</span></strong>: <a href="https://simplici7y.com/items/vasara" target="_blank">simplici<span class="decimal">7</span>y.com/items/vasara</a> <em>(last updated around eight years ago)</em><br /></li>
				<li><strong>Vasara AF</strong> (WIP): <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/vasara/" target="_blank">github.com/aaronfreed/vasara</a> <em>(requires Aleph One 1.7 or later; <strong>full disclosure:</strong> this update is largely my work)</em><br /></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong> (texturing, more like DOS&rsquo; command prompt; Forge visual mode replacement #2): <a href="https://simplici7y.com/items/visual-mode-lua" target="_blank">simplici<span class="decimal">7</span>y.com/items/visual-mode-lua</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>Forge+</strong> (texturing/map viewing; Forge visual mode replacement #3; see below): <a href="https://github.com/deramscholzara/ForgePlus/releases" target="_blank">github.com/deramscholzara/ForgePlus/releases</a></li>
		<li><strong>Atque</strong> (merging/splitting maps; replaces Forge&rsquo;s &ldquo;merge&rdquo; command): <a href="https://github.com/treellama/atque/releases" target="_blank">github.com/treellama/atque/releases</a></li>
		<li><strong>ShapeFusion</strong> (physics/shapes/sounds; replaces Anvil): <a href="https://github.com/treellama/shapefusion/releases" target="_blank">github.com/treellama/shapefusion/releases</a></li>

		<li><strong>Aorta</strong> (DDS/parallax map creation): <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/aorta" target="_blank">sourceforge.net/projects/aorta</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>While you might expect Forge+ to be roughly equivalent to Forge, Weland is actually much closer to it, to the extent that roughly 90% of the Forge tutorials can be applied wholesale to Weland. I list all the important differences I&rsquo;m aware of below, and they make up a relatively small portion of this document; for most users, setup will be by far the most complicated difference to navigate.</p>

	<p>Forge+ runs in Unity rather than Aleph One, which has some interesting ramifications. Because Aleph One is a portal engine, it is not possible to &ldquo;noclip&rdquo; into negative space (outside the map bounds); the engine needs to render using valid X, Y, Z, and polygon data to decide what should be visible, so attempting to render a scene from outside the bounds of any polygon simply crashes the engine. Unity, not being a portal engine, is not bound by this limitation, so you can use Forge+ to view an entire map at once from negative space. On the other hand, Forge+ is completely confused by &ldquo;5D space&rdquo; (two or more polygons occupying the same X/Y/Z space) and simply draws all walls.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, Forge+&rsquo;s feature set is nowhere near as robust as Weland&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s perfectly adequate for texturing, but without a hook to switch quickly back and forth between it and Weland, it&rsquo;s more impractical than it should be. However, it&rsquo;s still invaluable for providing a much better sense of the physical space various levels occupy.</p>

	<h3 id="visualmodecomparisons">Comparisons of Texturing Utilities</h3>
		
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Vasara <span class="number">1</span>.<span class="number">0</span>.<span class="number">3</span></strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Has the most straightforward interface; likely to be the least intimidating for new mapmakers.</li>
				<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Includes several bugs that aren&rsquo;t present in Vasara AF and/or Visual Mode.lua; owing to its creators&rsquo; disappearance from the community, it is unlikely to be updated again, so it will likely never support features like Aleph One 1.7&rsquo;s new transfer modes.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Vasara AF</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fixes several bugs and adds several new features (though a few are still works in progress). Several of these have not yet been backported to Visual Mode.lua (and some may never be).</li>
				<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Its interface probably will initially be more intimidating than Vasara 1.0.3&rsquo;s, and beginning mapmakers won&rsquo;t need some of its features. It also will not work with Aleph One versions prior to <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">7</span>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pros:</strong> It is extremely powerful and fast once you&rsquo;ve learned its interface, lacks several of Vasara 1.0.3&rsquo;s bugs, and has several features that aren&rsquo;t present in Vasara 1.0.3 (but are present in Vasara AF).</li>
				<li><strong>Cons:</strong> It will probably intimidate new mapmakers due to its bare-bones interface; it is missing several features of Vasara AF (and may never have them).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Forge+</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Since it runs in Unity, it can view maps from negative space, which would cause Aleph One to crash; this provides a much more holistic view of the shape of a level.</li>
				<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Unlike the other three options, Forge+ can&rsquo;t be linked to Weland, so you&rsquo;ll have to continually close and reopen the two apps, which is a pain. It also can&rsquo;t view maps using hi-res textures, and it hasn&rsquo;t been updated since 2022, so it&rsquo;s missing features like Aleph One 1.7&rsquo;s new transfer modes.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

<h2 id="editorsm1"><em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em> Format</h2>

	<p><em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em> content editing is barely supported on modern OSes, with one partial exception: You can extract <em>M<span class="decimal">1</span></em> sound files&rsquo; contents by splitting them with Atque, but it won&rsquo;t re-merge them into a format Aleph One reads as <em>M<span class="decimal">1</span></em> sounds. The &lsquo;Classic OS&rsquo; resources below require a Mac or emulator running System <span class="decimal">7</span> through <span class="decimal">9</span>. Setting one up is beyond this document&rsquo;s scope.</p>

	<ul style="text-align: left;">

	<p>To make this content compatible with modern Aleph One, you must run it through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBinary" target="_blank">MacBinary</a> (I&rsquo;ve never gotten this to work) or extract it from an emulator disk image with a program like <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/7358-hfvexplorer-1-3-1-for-windows-" target="_blank">HFV Explorer</a> (the method I used for my remastered <a href="https://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-1-remastered-sounds-2" target="_blank"><em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em></a> and <a href="https://hhas01.itch.io/trojan-se" target="_blank"><em>Trojan</em></a> sounds).</p>

<h1 id="welandsetup">Weland Setup</h1>
<h2 id="welandpreferences">Configuring Weland&rsquo;s Preferences</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Setting up Weland can be confusing; this doesn&rsquo;t aim to be an exhaustive list of the issues you may face in doing so. I can&rsquo;t possibly hope to provide that here; you&rsquo;ll find people who can help on the <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY">Discord</a>.</li>
		<li>You&rsquo;ll need either <strong>Gtk#</strong> or <strong>Mono</strong>, depending on your OS; the readme tells you which to get. (You&rsquo;ll also need <strong>.NET</strong> on Windows, but all Windows 10 and 11 computers should already have this installed, and if you&rsquo;re running an older version, you really should upgrade &ndash; running operating systems that are no longer being supported is a major security risk.) Installing the wrong one sometimes seems to make Weland not work, and they&rsquo;re on the same webpage, so users can get one thinking they&rsquo;ve gotten the other. Read carefully!</li>
		<li>After getting Weland to start, you&rsquo;ll next want to set up visual mode to function from within Weland. Go to <strong>Edit &gt; Preferences</strong>. You&rsquo;ll want the <strong>Shapes</strong> and <strong>Visual Mode</strong> segments to resemble these settings:

			<div class="image"><img src="welandprefs.png" alt="Weland preferences" title="Weland preferences" height="184" width="316" /></div>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Shapes File:</strong> valid <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">2</span></em>/<em>Infinity</em>-format shapes. <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em> shapes probably won&rsquo;t work, but I haven&rsquo;t tested this. This affects what Weland uses in visual mode and the overhead texture view.</li>
				<li><strong>Aleph One:</strong> the Aleph One app. EZ. My Windows examples use:
					<blockquote><code>C:/Games/Marathon Infinity/Marathon Infinity.exe</code></blockquote>
				For Macs, I use two examples:
					<blockquote><code>Macintosh HD/Games/Marathon Infinity/Marathon Infinity.app</code></blockquote>
					<blockquote><code>Macintosh HD/Games/Aleph One/Aleph One.app</code></blockquote>
				The reason for this will become apparent below.</li>
				<li><strong>Scenario:</strong> the folder you use within Aleph One to run the scenario you&rsquo;re editing. This is <em>usually</em> the folder with <strong>Map</strong>, <strong>Shapes</strong>, <strong>Images</strong>, and <strong>Sounds</strong>, but <em>Rubicon X</em> is an annoying exception: it uses a script to put these in a <strong>Rubicon Data</strong> subfolder. Use the containing <strong>Rubicon X</strong> folder, <em>not</em> Rubicon Data, for <em>Rubicon</em>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to set up an editor for visual mode. Despite the name, Weland&rsquo;s visual mode can use either <strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong> or <strong>Vasara</strong>, but whichever one you choose must be accessible to the scenario you wish to edit. I&rsquo;m going to divide the next segment into different sections for MacOS and Windows (I&rsquo;;ll add a Linux guide eventually).</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking.html">Advanced guide</a> &middot; <a href="/">Website index</a></p>

<h2 id="visualmodesetup">Visual Mode Setup</h2>
<h3 id="visualmodemac">Installing Visual Mode.lua or Vasara (MacOS)</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Owing to how the Mac version of Aleph One is built, setting up Visual Mode on Macs may be confusing. Effectively, on both the Mac and Windows, there are two ways to get Aleph One versions of the <em>Marathon</em> trilogy (there are, of course, even more on Linux), but which one you get is <em>vastly</em> more consequential on MacOS:
			<ul>
				<li>If you download the trilogy from the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/">front page of Aleph One&rsquo;s website</a>, you get &lsquo;all-in-one&rsquo; apps in which <em>all game data</em> are packaged within each game&rsquo;s application.</li>
				<li>You can also <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/scenario.html">download the game data by themselves</a> and use the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/download.html">general Aleph One app</a> to run them. (This is my preferred method, for reasons that should soon become apparent.)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>On the Mac, this distinction is <em>really important</em>, as it affects where Visual Mode.lua and/or Vasara should go:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Visual Mode.lua:</strong> It&rsquo;s best to put this in the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank">user data folder</a>. <em>Which</em> user data folder, though?
					<ul>
						<li><strong><em>Infinity</em> all-in-one app:</strong> 
							<blockquote class="wide"><pre>~/Library/Application Support/Marathon Infinity/Visual Mode.lua</pre></blockquote>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Standalone Aleph One app:</strong>
							<blockquote class="wide"><pre>~/Library/Application Support/AlephOne/Visual Mode.lua</pre></blockquote>
						</li>
						<li>Aleph One <em>only</em> makes this distinction on Macs: on Windows and Linux, it places all user data in one folder.</li>
						<li>Note also that the <strong>Library</strong> folder is normally hidden in the Finder, so to place Visual Mode.lua in one of its subfolders, you may need to use <strong>&lsquo;Go to Folder&rsquo;</strong>. Weland should be able to see it with no problem, though.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Vasara:</strong> There are a few options for this, which I&rsquo;ve chosen to list in descending order of how much they irk me.
					<ul>
						<li>Making a plugins folder in the same directory as an all-in-one app (e.g., <strong>Macintosh HD/Games/Marathon Infinity/Plugins/Vasara.zip</strong>) <em>won&rsquo;t work.</em> You&rsquo;d have to right-click or control-click the app, select &lsquo;<strong>Show Package Contents</strong>&rsquo;, <em>then</em> make a plugins folder <em>within</em> the app, e.g.:
							<blockquote class="wide"><pre>Macintosh HD/Games/Marathon Infinity/Marathon Infinity.app/Plugins/Vasara.zip</pre></blockquote>
							<ul>
								<li>I <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t care for this approach. While Mac apps are typically self-contained, this approach creates major downsides for scenario developers. Not all users even manage to get this method to work, and users probably shouldn&rsquo;t be encouraged to mess with app packages when it&rsquo;s not strictly necessary; they could easily break the apps if they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Another, less offensive solution for the all-in-one apps is the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank">user data</a> <strong>plugins folder</strong>. On a Mac, the all-in-one <em>Infinity</em> app would use:
							<blockquote class="wide"><pre>~Library/Application Support/Marathon Infinity/Plugins/Vasara.zip</pre></blockquote>
							The stand-alone Aleph One app would use:
							<blockquote class="wide"><pre>~Library/Application Support/AlephOne/Plugins/Vasara.zip</pre></blockquote>
							The Mac is also the only platform that separates the trilogy&rsquo;s user data folders from Aleph One&rsquo;s (another design choice I&rsquo;m not fully on board with), hence why I&rsquo;ve noted both locations for Macs.
							<ul>
								<li>This method actually isn&rsquo;t perfect either, since, as stated, the Library folder isn&rsquo;t visible by default &ndash; you have to navigate to it with <strong>&lsquo;Go to Folder&rsquo;</strong>. I find this much less bothersome than asking users to mess with app packages, though.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>The third option, and perhaps the most painless in the long run, is to ditch the all-in-one apps entirely, grab the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/scenarios.html">scenario data</a> by itself, and run it with the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/download.html">standalone Aleph One app</a> in the scenario directory &ndash; that way, you can keep Vasara inside your scenario directory, as Yrro intended. If you&rsquo;re in the middle of playing the trilogy and don&rsquo;t want to move your files over (itself a complicated process that is beyond the current scope of this guide), you can always keep a copy of the all-in-one apps to play the games, and just use the data and the stand-alone app for Vasara.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking.html">Advanced guide</a> &middot; <a href="/">Website index</a></p>

<h3 id="visualmodewin">Installing Visual Mode.lua & Vasara (Windows)</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong> is a solo Lua script, which is best placed in the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank">user data folder</a>. Thus, my Windows 10 path for it is:

			<blockquote class="wide"><pre>C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/AlephOne/Visual Mode.lua</pre></blockquote>

			Replace <strong>Aaron</strong> with your username to find where to place yours. (Linux and older versions of Windows will have different paths &ndash; and if you&rsquo;re running the latter, please get a new <del>computer</del> operating system: running an OS that&rsquo;s no longer being updated is a major security risk that puts all your data in jeopardy.)</li>
		<li><strong>Vasara</strong> is a plugin, so it belongs in the <strong>Plugins</strong> folder (if there isn&rsquo;t one already, make one called &lsquo;<strong>Plugins</strong>&rsquo;). This can be the scenario plugins folder:

			<blockquote class="wide"><pre>C:/Games/Marathon Infinity/Plugins/Vasara.zip</pre></blockquote>

			Or, if you&rsquo;d like it to be accessible to <em>all</em> scenarios, the <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank">user data</a> <strong>plugins folder</strong>, e.g.: 

				<blockquote class="wide"><pre>C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/AlephOne/Plugins/Vasara.zip</pre></blockquote>

			Which may be more convenient if, like me, you&rsquo;re perverse enough to map for five scenarios at a time, but you&rsquo;ll have to disable it outside Weland!Aleph One for any scenario for which you&rsquo;re not already using a solo Lua script.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking.html">Advanced guide</a> &middot; <a href="/">Website index</a></p>

<h2 id="visualmodepreferences">Configuring Weland!Aleph One</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The next steps may be slightly confusing. <em><strong>Without exiting Weland&rsquo;s preferences dialog,</strong></em> click the <strong>&lsquo;Edit Preferences&rsquo; button</strong>. This should launch Aleph One using the scenario you&rsquo;ve selected. <em><strong>This is entirely intended!</strong></em></li>
		<li><em><strong>Within Weland!Aleph One,</strong></em> click <strong>Settings</strong>. This creates a new preferences file (separate from the standard scenario preferences) that only affects the game&rsquo;s behavior <em>when it&rsquo;s launched from Weland</em> (e.g., launching <em>Marathon Infinity</em> from Weland creates a new &lsquo;<strong>Marathon Infinity Preferences Editor</strong>&rsquo; file within your Aleph One preferences folder).
			<ul>
				<li><strong>For Visual Mode.lua:</strong> Go to <strong>Environment</strong>, check <strong>&lsquo;Use Solo Script&rsquo;</strong> if it isn&rsquo;t already, then select <strong>&lsquo;Script File&rsquo;</strong> and find Visual Mode.lua in Aleph One&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations" target="_blank">user data folder</a> (Aleph One usually navigates from this folder by default).</li>
				<li><strong>For Vasara:</strong> This step depends slightly on your Aleph One version:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Aleph One <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">6</span>.<span class="decimal">2</span> or later:</strong> Select it under <strong>Plugins</strong>; no other plugins that use solo Lua should be active, and &lsquo;<strong>Use Solo Script</strong>&rsquo; in the <strong>Environment</strong> settings should be unchecked. If Vasara doesn&rsquo;t appear, double-check that you copied it to the right location.</li>
						<li><strong>Aleph One <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">4</span> to <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">6</span>.<span class="decimal">1</span>:</strong> The same as above, except <strong>Plugins</strong> is a button on the <strong>Environment</strong> page. Also, you should really upgrade your Aleph One version.</li>
						<li><strong>Aleph One <span class="decimal">1</span>.<span class="decimal">3</span>.<span class="decimal">1</span> and earlier:</strong> Please get a new <del>computer</del> Aleph One version. (No, seriously &ndash; launching Visual Mode from Weland requires at least Aleph One version 1.4.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>In either case, now select <strong>&lsquo;Accept&rsquo;</strong>, quit out of Aleph One, and select <strong>&lsquo;OK&rsquo;</strong> in the Weland dialog box. If you&rsquo;ve done everything correctly, you should now be able to launch visual mode in much the same way it launched from within Forge. If not, reread the above, try to ensure everything is set up as shown here, and if you still can&rsquo;t solve the issue, you may wish to ask for help at one of the above resources.</li>
		<li>I should perhaps note that several Windows users have reported only being able to get Weland to run correctly by using <a href="https://treellama.org/tmp/gtk-sharp-2.12.26.msi" target="_blank">Gtk# <span class="decimal">2</span>.<span class="decimal">12</span>.<span class="decimal">26</span></a> &ndash; a completely ancient release. No one has been able to produce a satisfactory hypothesis for why this is the case, but enough people have experienced it that it&rsquo;s ceased to look coincidental. (For the record, I didn&rsquo;t have to do this to get Weland to work on Windows; in fact, the setup process was quite painless for me.)</li>

<h1 id="basics">Mapmaking Basics</h1>
<h2 id="startertutorials">Tutorials & Resources for Beginning Mapmakers</h2>

	<p>Although the first two tutorials listed below were made for Forge, Weland has an almost identical interface, and 95% of what you see here will apply just as well to Weland once you have Vasara or Visual Mode.lua set up. The Forge manual has several errata, which I&rsquo;ve documented immediately below this section. Essentially, you&rsquo;ll use Weland for everything you&rsquo;d do from Forge&rsquo;s top-down view; you&rsquo;ll use Visual Mode.lua or Vasara for almost everything you&rsquo;d do in Forge&rsquo;s visual mode (currently, neither has an &lsquo;align heights&rsquo; feature); and you&rsquo;ll use Atque for merging and splitting maps.</p>

	<p>The modern replacement for Anvil is ShapeFusion; its feature set is very nearly identical to Anvil&rsquo;s, although it does a few things differently. Nonetheless, the annotated Anvil help balloons will be essential, since they&rsquo;re one of the few Anvil features not integrated into ShapeFusion. The default <em>Infinity</em> physics model is also essential because the &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; physics model distributed with <em>Marathon Infinity</em> is actually a <em>Marathon 2</em> physics model (thanks, Bungie), so if you want to edit VacBob or SMG physics, you&rsquo;ll have to grab the one from Simplici7y.</p>

<h2 id="forgeerrata">Forge Manual Errata & Omissions</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> The &lsquo;<strong>Locked Door</strong>&rsquo; flag is broken and doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</li>
	<li><strong>Lights:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The &lsquo;<strong>Stateless</strong>&rsquo; flag is broken and doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</li>
			<li>The manual says &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Period</strong>&rsquo; is &lsquo;the maximum random amount of time added to or subtracted from&rsquo; the value of <strong>Period</strong>. In fact, the game never subtracts <strong>&#916; Period</strong> from <strong>Period</strong>; it only ever adds them together.</li>
			<li>The manual&rsquo;s statement that &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Intensity</strong>&rsquo; &lsquo;does for <strong>Intensity</strong> what <strong>&#916; Period</strong> does for <strong>Period</strong>&rsquo; is technically correct (the best kind of correct!), but since its description of <strong>&#916; Period</strong> is wrong, I&rsquo;m listing it here for completeness&rsquo; sake.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Environment Types:</strong> The manual&rsquo;s description of &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>&rsquo; is completely outdated; it is a correct description of &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>&rsquo; flag strips all players&rsquo; weapons and ammunition, and if their health is above <span class="decimal">37</span> (full <span class="decimal">1</span>x shields would be <span class="decimal">150</span>), the game strips their health to <span class="decimal">37</span>. (Conversely, if their health is below <span class="decimal">37</span>, it does <em>not</em> restore it to <span class="decimal">37</span>. Also, note that all these values can be customized with MML). Additionally, if the &lsquo;<strong>Extermination</strong>&rsquo; mission type is set on a <strong>Rebellion</strong> level, <em>all</em> monsters set as &lsquo;<strong>Alien</strong>&rsquo; in the physics must, <em>without exception</em>, either be killed or (perhaps counterintuitively) have teleported out for the mission status to be set as &lsquo;<strong>Complete</strong>&rsquo;.</li>
	<li><strong>Mission Types:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>&lsquo;<strong>Rescue</strong>&rsquo; is broken. Use &lsquo;<strong>Rescue (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo; if you want this behaviour. Additionally, the &lsquo;<strong>Rescue (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo; mission affects whether the level completion state is set as &lsquo;<strong>Failed</strong>&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s still up to mapmakers to set the &lsquo;<strong>Finished</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>Unfinished</strong>&rsquo; states in other cases. aperturegrillz&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/rMSyuAsnIfc" target="_blank">speedrun of &lsquo;Bob-B-Q&rsquo;</a> shows us what can happen when a mapmaker neglects to set any mission types besides &lsquo;<strong>Rescue (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo;.</li>
			<li>&lsquo;<strong>Extermination</strong>&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t require killing <em>everything</em> unless, as mentioned above, the &lsquo;<strong>Rebellion</strong>&rsquo; flag is <em>also</em> set. Otherwise, the player gets a leeway of up to eight monsters marked as &lsquo;<strong>Alien</strong>&rsquo; in the physics. The game doesn&rsquo;t count monsters that are not marked as &lsquo;<strong>Alien</strong>&rsquo;, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they&rsquo;re set as hostile to the player. (You can force players to kill all monsters of one or more specific types using MML.) Also, the game disregards monsters that have teleported out for the sake of extermination missions, likely to prevent players from being unable to complete a mission if too many teleport out.</li>
			<li>I cover &lsquo;<strong>Exploration (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo; (potentially useful) and &lsquo;<strong>Repair (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong>&rsquo; (probably not) in my <a href="mapmaking.html#m1missions">advanced guide</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sound Objects:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>&lsquo;<strong>Is On Platform</strong>&rsquo; overrides the selected sound with the platform&rsquo;s ambient sound.</li>
			<li>&lsquo;<strong>&#916; Volume</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Period</strong>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Pitch</strong>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Direction</strong>&rsquo;, like the similar light values above, are only ever added to, respectively, <strong>Volume</strong>, <strong>Period</strong>, <strong>Pitch</strong>, and <strong>Direction</strong>; they are never subtracted. Additionally, for these values (but, curiously, <em>not</em> for the similar light variables), the game will never select the maximum delta value. Thus, if you set both <strong>Period</strong> and <strong>&#916; Period</strong> to 30, the game will select a value from 30 to 59, inclusive.</li>
			<li>While this isn&rsquo;t truly an erratum, &lsquo;<strong>&#916; Direction</strong>&rsquo; deserves further mention for a questionable design choice that can create the misleading impression that, for a sound to play from a constant direction, <strong>&#916; Direction</strong> should <em>exactly</em> match <strong>Direction</strong>: in fact, <strong>&#916; Direction</strong> should be 0&deg;. (If <strong>Direction</strong> and <strong>&#916; Direction</strong> are both 135&deg;, for example, the results will range from 135&deg; to 269&deg; (nice), inclusive.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Polygon Types:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The manual&rsquo;s description of the &lsquo;<strong>Invisible Monster Trigger</strong>&rsquo; was probably the intended behaviour of the polygon type, but in practice, it is the same as the &lsquo;<strong>Dual Monster Trigger</strong>&rsquo;: it activates all monsters in a zone, not just teleporting ones.</li>
			<li>Only players can trigger <strong>Platform On/Off Triggers</strong>, but both players and monsters can trigger <strong>Light On/Off Triggers</strong>.</li>
			<li>Monsters can&rsquo;t move over <strong>Teleporters</strong> and won&rsquo;t cross them (this doesn&rsquo;t apply to <strong>Automatic Exits</strong>).</li>
			<li>Although monsters usually can&rsquo;t move in <strong>Monster & Item Impassable</strong> polygons, they can if the player is in the same polygon they are. Also, they have been known to disregard the polygon type occasionally and enter it, although I&rsquo;m not at all sure what causes this; and of course, they can get pushed in.</li>
			<li>Monsters never drop items if they die on <strong>Item Impassable</strong>, <strong>Monster & Item Impassable</strong>, <strong>Platform</strong>, or <strong>Teleporter</strong> polygons, or on the edges of steps/ledges/cliffs.</li>
			<li><strong>Minor Ouch</strong>, <strong>Major Ouch</strong>, <strong>Glue</strong>, <strong>Glue Trigger</strong>, and <strong>Superglue</strong> were added to Aleph One for legacy <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em> compatibility. I address them in my <a href="mapmaking.html#m1polygons">advanced guide</a>, since beginning mapmakers probably won&rsquo;t need to bother with them.</li>

<h2 id="welandissues">Mapping Issues in Weland</h2>

<p>Weland differs from Forge in a few ways and has a few (mostly minor) bugs. Some issues users may currently encounter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Forge threw an error if you attempted to enter Visual Mode or save a map with any concave polygons. Weland just lets you do it. However, Forge&rsquo;s more aggressive treatment of the matter was justified in that the engine crashes if a player ever enters those polygons. By default, Weland colors concave polygons orange in Draw Mode, but if a lot of your polygons overlap in X/Y space, concave polygons may not be visible at a given time. Thus, be especially careful when moving lines, points, or polygons.</li>
	<li>Pressing &ldquo;Undo&rdquo; in any top-down view besides draw mode causes the selection to be reverted to the first item in the palette.</li>
	<li>&lsquo;<strong>Remember Deleted Sides</strong>&rsquo; is a wonderful Weland addition &ndash; it remembers the texturing and lighting of a side when you delete a polygon and refill it (e.g., with lines divided differently). Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t always work.</li>
	<li>&lsquo;<strong>Split Lines Attached to Polygons</strong>&rsquo;, another wonderful Weland addition, currently always results in lines being marked solid and transparent, regardless of whether they were originally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="texturingissues">Texturing Issues in Visual Mode.lua and Vasara</h2>

<p>A few problems occur when texturing in Aleph One that were not problems in Forge. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li>When you exit visual mode, tags should be in the state they&rsquo;re meant to start the level in. Thus, if you tabbed a tag switch that starts the level inactive so you could open some doors, reset the tag to inactive. Take special care with wires and chip insertion switches &ndash; messing them up can render levels uncompletable. This is one of several reasons I&rsquo;d recommend avoiding tags where possible &ndash; this is just the tip of the iceberg (you don&rsquo;t need to worry about <a href="mapmaking.html#tagsareterrible">the other reasons</a> until later).</li>
	<li>In Visual Mode.lua and Vasara 1.0.x, walking on a <strong>Must Be Explored</strong> polygon (or even looking at it if <strong>Exploration (M<span class="decimal">1</span>)</strong> is set) resets it to <strong>Normal.</strong> Be sure to reset these after texturing (or just don&rsquo;t set them until you&rsquo;ve finished texturing).
		<ul>
			<li>By default, <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/vasara" target="_blank">Vasara AF</a> (my WIP update) fixes this in a <span id="ftnt_ref01" class="dotted" title="Namely, when Vasara AF loads the map, it makes a table containing all polygons marked as &ldquo;Must Be Explored&rdquo;, then in Triggers.idle, Triggers.postidle, and Triggers.cleanup, it scans that list, and if any polygons have been set as &ldquo;Normal&rdquo;, it resets them to &ldquo;Must Be Explored&rdquo;. If this doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, don&rsquo;t worry; it&rsquo;s in a footnote because it&rsquo;s far beyond the scope of this guide.">fairly hacky way<a href="#ftnt01">&#8317;<span class="decimal">&sup1;</span>&#8318;</a></span> that has the cost of making it impossible to complete <strong>Exploration</strong> mission types while Vasara AF is running. However, Vasara AF is a texturing app above all, and this is much closer to the Forge behaviour mapmakers are likely to expect.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In old versions of Aleph One (prior to 1.6, if memory serves), frame interpolation could cause textures to jitter if you placed them without paving first. Some players also reported that placing textures without first paving could cause crashes (I never experienced this, and it was also supposedly fixed in the same Aleph One update). However, paving occasionally crashes Weland (I haven&rsquo;t isolated the cause, but it seems to be an index mismatch), so it&rsquo;s ideal to save, pave, then go into visual mode.</li>
	<li>By necessity, texturing always loads all textures, so you may sometimes want to avoid using hi-res textures while texturing. You&rsquo;ll probably want to run through the map with the hi-res textures on once you&rsquo;ve finished your initial pass, though; when you do so, I recommend keeping as few other programs open as possible.</li>
	<li>Visual Mode.lua did not handle wires correctly until version 3.0.2, released on 2024-01-19. If you&rsquo;re having trouble getting them to work correctly, upgrade to the latest version or use Vasara.</li>
	<li>Forge&rsquo;s &ldquo;align heights in visual mode&rdquo; feature doesn&rsquo;t exist in any modern editor; it&rsquo;s necessary to exit visual mode, change the polygon&rsquo;s heights, then go back to visual mode to texture it (or use Lua to do that, if you know it; one of several reasons I added overlays to Vasara AF was to facilitate this). If you&rsquo;re on the obsessive-compulsive spectrum like me, you probably hated Forge&rsquo;s implementation of this feature because it didn&rsquo;t actually align heights correctly (see <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/vasara#planned-features" target="_blank">my discussion in in Vasara&rsquo;s readme</a> for specifics). However, I plan to add a less sloppy implementation to Vasara AF once I&rsquo;m satisfied with my UI design. (I&rsquo;m not a UI specialist and have long held that UI is far too important to be left up to programmers that aren&rsquo;t UI specialists.)</li>
	<li>Occasional issues with platforms&rsquo; texture alignment.
		<ul>
			<li>If you&rsquo;re using a version of Aleph One prior to <span class="decimal">1.6</span>:
				<ol>
					<li>Upgrade, for the love of Pthia.</li>
					<li>When you exit visual mode (or type <strong>.save level</strong>), platforms that extend <strong>From Ceiling</strong> or <strong>From Both</strong> <em>must</em> be in the same position they start the level in, or you&rsquo;ll get texture misalignments.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Aleph One <span class="decimal">1.6</span> largely fixes this and a related platform alignment bug that occurred even in the original engine. Slight misalignments &ndash; 1/1024 of a standard texture repetition, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken &ndash; may still occur if you close the editor while the platform is moving, but it seems to be entirely fine if the platform is at rest. To keep this section from getting too far into the weeds, I&rsquo;ve moved <span id="ftnt_ref02" class="dotted">possible solutions for platforms that must move continually to an endnote.<a href="#ftnt02">&#8317;<span class="decimal">&sup2;</span>&#8318;</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="vasaratexturing">Further Texturing Issues in Vasara</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Vasara 1.0.x gets weird with more than <span class="decimal">56</span> lights. If you have both &lsquo;Apply Light&rsquo; and &lsquo;Apply Texture&rsquo; selected with a light &#8805; <span class="decimal">56</span>, the HUD disappears; reduce the light value to something &lt; <span class="decimal">56</span> and hit the action key to restore it. If one is selected, but not the other, the HUD functions normally.
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/vasara" target="_blank">Vasara AF</a> (my WIP update) fixes the Lua error spam. It currently does not display previews of lights greater than 55 correctly, but it lists lights from 0 to 97 in its options screen.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you leave visual mode (or type <strong>.save level</strong>) while a polygon is flashing and highlighted on the map for the player to teleport to, this will be set as a <strong>Major Ouch</strong> polygon and the floor&rsquo;s transfer mode will change to <strong>Static</strong>. So&hellip; don&rsquo;t do that. This occurs because Vasara highlights the polygon on the map by changing it temporarily to a <strong>Major Ouch</strong> polygon (and physically changes its appearance in the game world to create the static effect on its floor).
		<ul>
			<li>Fixing this would require not highlighting the polygon on the map, and after trying that for a bit, I found it more annoying than the current behavior. I&rsquo;m working on a possible compromise.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advancedtutorials">Advanced Tutorials & Resources</h2>

	<p>I can&rsquo;t vouch for the accuracy of all of this info (except, I hope, my own page), and you definitely shouldn&rsquo;t worry about most of this stuff until later &ndash; you need to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals before moving onto more advanced techniques. (If you don&rsquo;t know how to play a paradiddle, you aren&rsquo;t ready to cover a Neil Peart solo.) Hastur&rsquo;s Workshop is listed first here because it&rsquo;s the first advanced tutorial you should read &ndash; while not all of it is still relevant, you can still find helpful nuggets even in the seemingly irrelevant bits (e.g., viewing distances are no longer limited to 30 World Units, but the tips on that page can still be helpful for making spaces seem larger than they are, which is especially helpful since there are really only about 63 usable World Units in each direction).</p>

				<li>If you want to make <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">2</span></em> maps, I recommend configuring Weland to use <em>Marathon Infinity</em> as the scenario and this as the shapes. <strong>Vasara</strong> and <strong>Visual Mode.lua</strong> look for the Jjaro collection by default, and weird things happen if they don&rsquo;t find it. (You can edit them to prevent this, but this prevents the need for that, or for changing Weland&rsquo;s scenario from <em>Marathon Infinity</em> to <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">2</span></em> and back.)</li>

<h1 id="contact">Contact Info</h1>

	<p>The fastest way to contact me is Discord. You can ping me on the <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY" target="_blank">Marathon Discord server</a> at <strong>@aaron6608</strong> (or <strong>@Aaron#<span class="decimal">6608</span></strong>), though it&rsquo;s entirely possible others may be able to answer your questions before I see them, so I recommend this only if you notice errors/omissions in this document (or have suggestions for additions; if you remind me, I can credit you for any of the above). If you need help, I recommend asking in <strong>#classic-marathon</strong>, <span id="ftnt_ref04" class="dotted" title="Which, despite carrying the name of a program hardly anyone has actively used for fifteen years, is meant for all map, physics, shapes, and sound creation for the Marathon trilogy."></span><strong>#forge</strong><a href="#ftnt04">&#8317;<span class="decimal">&#8308;</span>&#8318;</a></span>, or <strong>#tech-support</strong>. (<strong>#development</strong> is intended only for engine and editor development, so unless you&rsquo;re specifically discussing Vasara AF, you should probably ping me in one of the other three channels.)</p>
	
	<p>I&rsquo;m also on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed" target="_blank">aaronfreed</a>, naturally. You can <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/aaronfreed.github.io/issues/" target="_blank">create an issue</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/aaronfreed.github.io/pulls" target="_blank">submit a pull request</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/aaronfreed.github.io/discussions" target="_blank">start a discussion</a>. I do ask that users be respectful (both of me and of others) and note that I maintain this page on my own time, for free, while also juggling multiple active development projects that I&rsquo;m also working on, also for free. The <a href="https://github.com/aaronfreed/aaronfreed.github.io/discussions/1" target="_blank">rules I outline for my discussion section</a> apply equally well to issues and pull requests.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;m also on the <a href="https://pfhorums.com" target="_blank">Pfhorums</a> (as <a href="https://pfhorums.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=6618" target="_blank">The Man</a>) and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/marathon/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> (as <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aaronnotarobot" target="_blank">u/aaronnotarobot</a>), but I can&rsquo;t promise to respond to messages on either quickly. Lastly, I do, of course, have an email address, but:</p>

	<ol class="loweralpha">
		<li>Email is very nearly the <em>worst</em> way to contact me.</li>
		<li>The days when it was a good idea to post an email address on a public webpage are long over.</li>
	</ol>

<h1 id="bio">What qualifies you to write this, anyway?</h1>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve been modding for this engine off and on since 1997 and have worked on a long list of projects over the years; rather than list them all here, you can just check my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>. As mentioned, I also have a much longer <a href="mapmaking.html">mapmaking page</a> that goes into much more depth.</p>

	<p>You may also be interested in my <a href="soundtracks.html"><em>Marathon</em> soundtracks page</a>. I have some additional <em>Marathon</em>-related music on my <a href="discography.html">discography page</a>. Additionally, my <a href="remastering.html">notes on my remastering process</a> may be helpful to those working on sounds or music.</p>

				<td>Namely, when Vasara AF loads the map, it makes a table containing all polygons marked as &ldquo;Must Be Explored&rdquo;, then in <code>Triggers.idle</code>, <code>Triggers.postidle</code>, and <code>Triggers.cleanup</code>, it scans that list, and if any polygons have been set as &ldquo;Normal&rdquo;, it resets them to &ldquo;Must Be Explored&rdquo;. If this doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, don&rsquo;t worry; it&rsquo;s in a footnote because it&rsquo;s far beyond the scope of this guide.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="integer"><a href="#ftnt_ref02" id="ftnt02"><strong>2</strong></a></td>
				<td><ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
						<li style="margin-top: 0px;">Tie the platform&rsquo;s activation to some specific action on the map, such as a &ldquo;platform on trigger&rdquo; on the player&rsquo;s spawn polygon; then X+click to load the level from elsewhere when you go to texture.</li>
						<li>Set the &ldquo;platform on trigger&rdquo; as something besides the starting polygon that players must walk on before they can see the platform; then teleport around the map to avoid walking on it.</li>
						<li>Another solution is reportedly to type <code>.save level</code> in the Lua console rather than to close visual mode; you&rsquo;ll then have to (re)load the version you saved (which will show up <a href="https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone/wiki/File-Locations#saved-games--films--screenshots--saved-levels" target="_blank">here</a>) in Weland.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 0px;">If you use any of the above solutions, you&rsquo;ll need to remember to repeat your chosen solution each time you open visual mode. If you&rsquo;re comfortable with Lua, you can save yourself the trouble by simply having the level&rsquo;s Lua script activate platforms in <code>Triggers.init</code>. (I strongly recommend never using polygon IDs in Lua scripts, since you&rsquo;d have to rewrite them after deleting polygons with smaller IDs; instead, put goal objects on them with checkpoints set to a memorable number you won&rsquo;t use for anything else.)</li>
					</ul>

				<td class="integer"><a href="#ftnt_ref03" id="ftnt03"><strong>3</strong></a></td>
				<td><em>Trojan</em>, <em>EVIL</em>, <em>Tempus Irae</em>, <em>RED</em>, <em>Eternal X</em>, <em>Rubicon X</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>, <em>Mararthon Yuge</em>, <em>Apotheosis X</em>, and <em>Istoria</em>.
					
					<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
						<li>I&rsquo;d unconditionally recommend <em>Tempus Irae</em>, <em>Eternal X</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>, and <em>Apotheosis X</em> (note: I&rsquo;ve contributed in some capacity to current or forthcoming releases of all of these: remastered music for <em>Phoenix</em>; sounds and scripting for <em>Apotheosis X</em>; too many things to list for <em>Eternal X</em> and <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>).</li>
						<li><em>Rubicon X</em> and <em>Istoria</em> round out my top six with the caveats &lsquo;don&rsquo;t play <em>Rubicon X</em> above Normal unless you think LASO is fun&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Flame IADD fight can heck right off&rsquo;.</li>
						<li>If you&rsquo;re attuned to <em>Yuge</em>&rsquo;s irreverent humour, it&rsquo;ll reward you with fantastic gameplay and a remarkable demonstration of procedural level design.</li>
						<li><em>Trojan</em> is great for those who wish <em>Marathon <span class="decimal">1</span></em> had been longer. Even if you don&rsquo;t play it, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/bKQnv8zg8rk" target="_blank">the OST</a>, which slaps. (Also, I remastered the music and sounds for the <a href="https://hhas01.itch.io/trojan-se">standalone edition</a>; unfortunately, its fork of Aleph One is years behind its current feature set).</li>
						<li><em>RED</em>&rsquo;s execution can be sloppy, and it&rsquo;s probably too difficult, but it has some fantastic ideas and artwork, and it&rsquo;s remarkable for having been made almost entirely by a single person &ndash; a teenager at the time, to boot. It&rsquo;s little surprise that he later became a professional game and webcomic artist with credits including the <em>Slime Rancher</em> series, <em>Spiral Knights</em>, <em>Three Panel Soul</em>, and <em>Mac Hall</em>.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Lastly, <em>EVIL</em>&rsquo;s strengths include professional-quality sprites; fantastic sounds, monsters, and weapons; and sometimes brilliant (if frustratingly inconsistent) level design.</li>
