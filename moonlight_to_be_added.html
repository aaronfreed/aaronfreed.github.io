<h3 class="centred" id="dikaiosunekaiisotes">«Δῐκαιοσῠ́νη καί ἰσότης νῑκήσουσῐν»</h3>

<em class="accentlinks">[Note: For context, when this section is complete, it will immediately follow the section «<a href="moonlight.html#enokhroiselenofoti" lang="grc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline songlink">Ε&#787;ν ὠχρῷ σελήνόφωτῐ́</a>»</a>. Thus, the “final stanza” it’s referring to is the Greek stanza of the lyrics near the end of that section.]</em>

<p>The final stanza is also inspired by <em>Eternal</em> (which in turn is heavily inspired by a secret message in <em>Marathon 2</em>’s level “Kill Your Television”). In particular, the line <span class="toc-counter">«Δῐκαιοσῠ́νη καί ἰσότης νῑκήσουσῐν»</span> (<span class="toc-counter">“Justice and equality will prevail”</span>) is a direct result of <em>Eternal</em>’s deep connection to Egyptian mythology: it includes characters named after the Egyptian deities Hathor, Bast(et), Sakhmet, and Apep; directly refers to several Egyptian myths; and is heavily influenced by the Egyptians’ concept of balance, which, as I shall explain, was arguably substantially more complex than our modern one.</p>

<p>Some of our labels end up generalizing heavily about human history. “Ancient Greece”, at the short end, refers to a timespan of about 750 years (Ischia’s settlement in 785 BCE to the Roman conquest in 31-30 BCE); the upper end of typical usage encompasses just under two millennia (Euboea’s rise ca. 1200 BCE to the second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717-718 CE), although one could argue that because Aegean Greece (3300 BCE) qualifies as both ancient and Greek, “ancient Greece” should properly encompass a span of <em>over four millennia</em>.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt is similar. Convention holds that it begins with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3150 BCE and ends with its annexation by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE. That’s over three millennia – more than half of recorded human history. Therefore, everything I’m about to write will, by necessity, be a broad generalization. Interpretations of Egyptian mythology varied widely over the course of its history.</p>

<p>I think Ancient Egypt gets something of a bad rap. The Book of Exodus may be partly to blame for this. (Modern scholars mostly consider its account to be largely ahistorical: archaeological evidence suggests the Israelites to have been largely indigenous to Canaan, with an at most small group being exiled Egyptians. The Torah’s narrative may contain an historical core in having been contributed by this group.) It should go without saying that slavery is an atrocity, but people seem to hold it against the Egyptians much more than they hold it against the Romans and Greeks. You’d almost forget that ‘ancilla’ comes from a Latin word for ‘slave-girl’.</p>

<p>In any case, by the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Egyptian law treated women much better than the Greeks or Romans did at the time, allowing them substantial independence and freedom to own property. This eventually influenced Greek and Roman law. To some degree, Egypt’s more progressive stance on women’s rights is also reflected in its pantheon, whose goddesses include some of mythology’s most fascinating, multifaceted characters.</p>

<p>That said, Egyptian mythology was less concerned with good and evil than with order and chaos. This isn’t to say Egypt didn’t have benevolent or malevolent deities. Contrary to popular belief, far and away their pantheon’s most malevolent deity was Apep, who might, in fact, be the most malevolent deity in <em>any</em> major pantheon. How many other deities throughout history have people prayed <em>against</em>? I literally can’t think of any.</p>

<p>Apep was the living embodiment of the phrase “chaotic evil”; his epithets included “Lord of Chaos”. He resented reality’s very existence and therefore sought to unmake it; the Egyptians believed the sun went down because Ra had to fight Apep <em>every night</em> to stop him from doing so.</p>

<p>Since the Greeks renamed much of the Egyptian pantheon, you may also know Apep as Apophis. Besides (possibly) Sobek, Bastet, and Apep, the Greek names are now better known: <em>Thoth</em>, <em>Osiris</em>, <em>Isis</em>, and <em>Anubis</em> are far more recognizable than <em>Djehuti</em>, <em>Wesir</em>, <em>Aset</em>, or <em>Inepu</em>. That said, a few of the names didn’t change:</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="pantesturannoi">«Πᾰ́ντες τῠ́ρᾰννοι οͅφείλωσῐ δείσειν»</h3>

<p>Speaking of Ma’at, she’s the main reason I’m discussing Egyptian mythology in such detail.</p>

<p>Ma’at is often characterized as the Egyptian goddess of order. This isn’t technically <em>wrong</em>, but, like many popular beliefs about Ancient Egypt, it’s also not the full picture. Ma’at was both a deity and an ideological concept. Isfet, her ideological opposite, wasn’t a deity and was instead personified by Apep (Ma’at’s theological opposite, to absolutely no one’s surprise). This is only natural: chaos is, of course, order’s opposite.</p>

<p>However, Ma’at wasn’t merely the goddess of order. She was also the goddess of balance, justice, reciprocity, harmony, ethics, and truth. And my reading is that, even more importantly, the Egyptians considered these concepts inseparable: to them, a fundamentally unjust or imbalanced society was <em>by definition</em> not an ordered society.</p>

<p>(I apologize if this gets confusing, by the way: we’re discussing ancient Egyptian concepts that don’t map exactly to English words, so my descriptions will be at best imprecise.)</p>

<p>I already mentioned that Apep is effectively the embodiment of chaotic evil. Let’s extend the <em>D&D</em> metaphor further. Ma’at is sometimes categorized as lawful good, but since she’s the goddess of balance, I think neutral good is a much better fit. Lawful good can lend itself to fanaticism.</p>

<p>I didn’t have to play <em>D&D</em> for long before I realized how much easier it is in practice to be neutral good than to be either lawful good or chaotic good. The latter two require consistent conformity to rigid behavior patterns that may not actually be pragmatic ways to accomplish the most good. Chaotic good characters might be unable to work within the system when doing so affords them greater abilities to create positive outcomes. Lawful good characters might be unable to work outside systems when they prove inflexible and resistant to actions needed to help or protect people. In fact, such characters might not even be able to <em>consider</em> such courses of action. Neutral good affords players the ability not just to <em>consider</em> both, but to <em>do</em> both.</p>

<p>In short, neutral good is the logical choice for any player seeking to provide the greatest good to the greatest number. <em>D&D</em> doesn’t reflect reality in every possible manner, but in this regard, I feel it’s quite on point.</p>

<p>If Ma’at, as the goddess of balance, is neutral good, then it follows that chaotic evil cannot be her only opposite. Lawful evil – in other words, tyranny – must be just as much her opposite.</p>

<p>This actually seems to reflect the Egyptians’ view. While they contrasted order with chaos, they also contrasted it with tyranny. But they also don’t appear to have seen tyranny and chaos as synonyms. And this is one place where I don’t think D&D maps precisely to reality.</p>

<p>We see order and chaos as a linear spectrum, but if the Egyptians saw order as <em>balance</em>, then they’d logically also see it as lying <em>between</em> two undesirable extremes. We often see opposites as points on two opposite sides of a circle or spectrum. But Ma’at is more accurately seen as the <em>center</em> of a circle or spectrum, and her opposites as points on either side.</p>

<p>The extreme on the other side of chaos can be seen as false order, as artificially imposed order, as law without justice, or simply as tyranny. It’s what a ruler attempts to impose upon subjects without actually solving their problems – without the actual <em>work</em> of governing. Thus, tyranny is as much an opposite of order as chaos is.</p>

<p>Although this doesn’t encompass all nine possible alignments in D&D, the Egyptian spectrum might be thought of as encompassing seven of them, wherein the closer you are to 0, the better:</p>

<ol start="-3">
	<li>Chaotic evil</li>
	<li>Chaotic neutral</li>
	<li>Chaotic good</li>
	<li>Neutral good</li>
	<li>Lawful good</li>
	<li>Lawful neutral</li>
	<li>Lawful evil</li>
</ol>

<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#contents">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

<h3 class="centred" id="onedeprived">“One deprived becomes an opponent”</h3>

<p>The principles of Ma’at, as written in <em>The Instructions of Ptahhotep</em>, called the rich and powerful to help those less fortunate than themselves rather than to exploit them:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Be generous as long as you live.<br />
What leaves the storehouse does not return;<br />
It is the food to be shared which is coveted.<br />
One whose belly is empty is an accuser;<br />
One deprived becomes an opponent.<br />
Don’t have him for a neighbor.<br />
Kindness is a man’s memorial<br />
For the years after the function.</blockquote>

<p>In short, the most important principle is to treat others benevolently and kindly. But to the Egyptians, the above passage was also a practical argument. Remember, they believed that for a person’s immortal soul to reach the afterlife, their corpse must be properly cared for – they considered mummification, buried goods, and funerary incantations necessary to preserve <em>ka</em>, the vital force within the soul. Without proper care, the deceased could suffer damnation to a realm of fire, chaos, and conflict (so, the Christian hell in all but name). This made proper care of their memorials or tombs a matter of paramount importance to them. So effectively, the above excerpt is a carrot-and-stick appeal to rich people’s pragmatism:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="toc-counter weight3"><span class="petitecaps">Stick:</span> <span class="maincolor light">Fail to feed the hungry, and they’ll become unruly and rebellious.</span></li>
	<li class="toc-counter weight3"><span class="petitecaps">Carrot:</span> <span class="maincolor light">Feed them, and they’ll safeguard your immortal soul after you depart the mortal plane.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="margintop16">In another text, <em>The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant</em>, an officer, under the king’s direction, confiscates a nobleman’s wealth and gives it to a peasant the nobleman had abused. A third text says that a ruler who follows Ma’at:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">educates the ignorant to wisdom,<br />
and those who are unloved become as those who are loved.<br />
He causes the lesser folk to emulate the great:<br />
the last become as the first.<br />
He who was lacking possessions is (now) the possessor of riches.</blockquote>

<p>And <em>The Moaning of the Bedouin</em>, a popular tale from the Middle Kingdom, said that:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Those who destroy the lie promote Ma'at;<br />
those who promote the good will erase the evil.<br />
As fullness casts out appetite,<br />
as clothes cover the nude, and<br />
as heaven clears up after a storm.</blockquote>

<p>Ma’at held that the spirit of justice was more important than the letter of the law. Egyptian rulers were held to high standards: the Egyptians believed rulers’ failure to act impartially and justly could cause a famine. Egyptian citizens were expected to act truthfully and honorably in their daily lives within all familial, communal, national, environmental, and religious matters.</p>

<p>Ma’at was also a close analogue of (and may even have inspired) St. Peter: in the afterlife, she would weigh the good a person had done against the ill they had done. Those who had done more good would go to the afterlife; those who had done more ill would have their hearts devoured by Ammit, and their consciousness would effectively cease to exist entirely.</p>

<p>This is an interesting contrast with Christianity, especially since I’ve already compared its hell to the Egyptian concept of damnation. The Egyptians believed you couldn’t even reach the point of judgement if your corpse wasn’t properly cared for – if you annoyed people badly enough, it wouldn’t matter how much good you’d done. Meanwhile, if people saw you as worthy enough to care for your mortal soul, but you hadn’t done enough good to outweigh your misdeeds, you just ceased to exist.</p>

<p>I’m not calling this <em>better</em> than the Christian afterlife, mind you. Nor am I calling it worse. It’s just different.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="vacuumofbalance">“Nature resists even a vacuum of balance”</h3>

<p>One of <em>Eternal</em>’s central themes is that both extreme order and extreme chaos are destructive and undesirable. If you have even a slight interest in playing it, you may wish to skip to “The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone”, but I’ll try to avoid spoiling anything more than the broad strokes of the plot.</p>

<p>The backstory involves a chaotic evil being (which is, not coincidentally, nicknamed Apep, although its true name is never revealed) and a lawful evil faction that increasingly resemble each other as the story progresses. In fact, while they purport to be at war with each other, we deliberately left it open to interpretation how true this is.</p>

<p>Apep wants to destroy the galaxy for not entirely comprehensible reasons. He claims to have come from the galaxy’s original timeline, and wants to destroy it so he can restore the original timeline. Of course, that’s not how it works. If Apep is truly that powerful, he should be able to just travel back to his timeline. We imply that Apep has Seen Things You People Wouldn’t Believe and has been left a bit less than fully rational. (Reflecting this, his sole message to the player switches between Early Modern English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Hungarian, Latin, Attic Greek, and Japanese, for no apparent reason.)</p>

<p>The lawful evil faction is dead-set on preserving history exactly as it occurred – the exact history that gave them their powers. (I’m sure it’s just coincidence; what tyrants in history have ever had selfish motives?) Unfortunately, that history <em>ends</em> when Apep destroys the galaxy. The lawful evil faction just <em>doesn’t care</em> because, by this time, they’ve escaped our reality. The AI Durandal-Thoth, one of the player’s main allies, thus writes in the game’s closing message that the lawful evil faction:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">may consider themselves Apep’s opponents in theory; but their rigid fealty to a timeline in which the galaxy is destroyed gives that vengeful demon exactly what it wants, thus making them in practice stronger allies than it could ever have dreamt of. Failing to understand this is their tragic irony; perhaps they lack the needed self-awareness, but whatever the cause, it thus falls upon us to oppose both.
	<blockquote class="speaker">–<strong class="petitecaps">Durandal-Thoth</strong>, “The Near Side of Everywhere”</blockquote></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<em>Enantiodromia</em> (Greek: <em>ἐναντῐοδρομία</em>) means <em>running contrarily</em> or <em>opposite running course</em>; it is a composite of <em>ἐνᾰντῐ́ος</em> (<em>enănti&#774;&#769;os</em>, <em>opposite</em>) and <em>δρόμος</em> (<em>drómos</em>, <em>racetrack</em>). The Macedonian anthologist Johannes Stobaeus (Greek: <em>Ἰωάννης ὁ Στοβαῖος</em>, <em>Iōánnēs ho Stobaíos</em>, literally <em>John the Stobian</em>) apparently invented it to describe a concept of the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus (<em>Ἡράκλειτος</em>, <em>Hērákleitos</em>), who wrote, <span class="toc-counter">“Cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry, and parched things get wet.”</span></p>

<p>A related concept within Heraclitus’ writings was the unity of opposites, expressed in its successive form in the above quote and in its compresent form in his aphorism, <span class="toc-counter">“The road up and the road down are the same thing.”</span> To Heraclitus, the only constant was change itself, which created a unity of opposites in that the universe simultaneously contained difference and sameness. In short, opposites are connected by their relationship to each other: hot and cold, pleasure and pain, moisture and dryness, are defined in relation to each other.</p>

<p>The important point is that, in the absence of balance, things turn into their opposites especially often. Another character in <em>Eternal</em> (I’m omitting her identity because it’s a major spoiler) writes:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Ma’at comes from living in harmony with nature and with each other, from being benevolent and kind, from being honourable and truthful, from alleviating the suffering of those less fortunate than us rather than exploiting their misfortune. Order cannot exist without balance or justice, and trying too hard to impose it results in chaos, just as trying too hard to fit a square peg into a round hole breaks the peg.

<p>Of the game’s two villainous factions, she adds:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter"><p>Protest as they might, their clash is not a fundamental philosophical disagreement, but a mere fight to emerge atop a hierarchy. Both take as granted that in-groups will be protected but not bound by the law, and that out-groups will be bound but not protected by it. They are merely fighting to be the in-group. They may see each other as opposites, but they are merely two shades of tyranny.</p>

<p>The logical counterproposal, of course, is that the law must equally both protect and bind <em>everyone</em>, including leaders. No leader can truly embody the balance or justice of Ma’at unless bound by the law.

<h3 class="centred" id="wilhoit">“The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone”</h3>

<p>Most of the above <em>Eternal</em> quotes are my own words, but the line about in-groups and the counterproposal both paraphrase a now widely quoted comment that composer Frank Wilhoit (whom I acknowledge as an influence in the game’s secret credit terminal) posted to the website Crooked Timber on 2018-03-22. I consider it thought-provoking enough to quote it here in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter"><p>There is no such thing as liberalism — or progressivism, etc.</p>

<p>There is only conservatism. No other political philosophy actually exists; by the political analogue of Gresham’s Law, conservatism has driven every other idea out of circulation.</p>

<p>There might be, and should be, anti-conservatism; but it does not yet exist. What would it be? In order to answer that question, it is necessary and sufficient to characterize conservatism. Fortunately, this can be done very concisely.</p>
	
<p>Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:</p>

<p>There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.</p>

<p>There is nothing more or else to it, and there never has been, in any place or time.</p>

<p>For millennia, conservatism had no name, because no other model of polity had ever been proposed. “The king can do no wrong.” In practice, this immunity was always extended to the king’s friends, however fungible a group they might have been. Today, we still have the king’s friends even where there is no king (dictator, etc.). Another way to look at this is that the king is a faction, rather than an individual.</p>

<p>As the core proposition of conservatism is indefensible if stated baldly, it has always been surrounded by an elaborate backwash of pseudophilosophy, amounting over time to millions of pages. All such is axiomatically dishonest and undeserving of serious scrutiny. Today, the accelerating de-education of humanity has reached a point where the market for pseudophilosophy is vanishing; it is, as The Kids Say These Days, tl;dr. All that is left is the core proposition itself — backed up, no longer by misdirection and sophistry, but by violence.</p>

<p>So this tells us what anti-conservatism must be: the proposition that the law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone, and cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</p>

<p>Then the appearance arises that the task is to map ‘liberalism’, or ‘progressivism’, or ‘socialism’, or whateverthefuckkindofstupidnoise-ism, onto the core proposition of anti-conservatism.</p>

<p>No, it a’n’t. The task is to throw all those things on the exact same burn pile as the collected works of all the apologists for conservatism, and start fresh. The core proposition of anti-conservatism requires no supplementation and no exegesis. It is as sufficient as it is necessary. What you see is what you get:</p>

<p><strong><em>The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t agree with every word Wilhoit writes here, but I don’t <em>need</em> to, just as I don’t care if others self-identify as anarchist or socialist or liberal or progressive or Marxist or syndicalist or mutualist or libertarian or Burkean, or even conservative, for that matter. I think he’s oversimplifying, at least if people like Edmund Burke qualify as conservatives. (Wilhoit may well be right about the debased modern political ideology that now calls itself conservatism.) Nonetheless, his core proposition is ultimately the core of every important point to be made about politics: the law is fundamentally unjust unless it binds and protects everyone.</p>

<p>I’d take it a step further, in fact. I’d phrase it in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>The law is fundamentally unjust unless it binds and protects everyone exactly no more and exactly less than it binds and protects everyone else.</em></strong></blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, we leave ourselves open to <span class="toc-counter">“All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others”</span>-type loophole abuse. My other political principles all stem directly from that core proposition, and if you can agree with it, I’m sure we can find plenty of common ground. (Burke might even agree, since, as you may recall, he wrote, <span class="toc-counter">“Liberty, if I understand it at all, is a <em>general</em> principle, and the clear right of all the subjects within the realm, or of none,”</span> and, <span class="toc-counter">“Nothing is security to any individual but the common interest of all.”</span>)</p>

<p>In short, if the law does not obey the principles of Ma’at, it is not just. Wrapped up in the entire concept of Ma’at, in fact, is the idea that the spirit of justice supersedes the letter of the law.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="thedarkerashadow">“The more intensely that the light shone, the darker a shadow it cast”</h3>

<p>One of the profoundest statements on mental health I’ve encountered is by the Welsh musician Ren Aryn Gill, who most frequently uses his given name as a mononym. His song “<a href="https://youtu.be/s_nc1IVoMxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hi Ren</a>” has been called this century’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”, which I think actually undersells it in some ways. It’s not actually as musically intricate as Queen’s masterpiece, which was constructed in the studio, with heavy reliance on overdubbed three-part harmonies. Then again, Ren also performed it live rather than constructing it in the studio. It’s just him and a guitar, and it’s a stunning performance; it is probably telling that it recently overtook Nightwish’s <a href="https://youtu.be/JYjIlHWBAVo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wacken 2013 performance</a> of “Ghost Love Score” as the most reacted-to musical performance in YouTube’s history.</p>

<p>More importantly, “Hi Ren” says things about mental health that I’ve rarely seen anyone acknowledge. It’s the most complete depiction I’ve ever seen of what the creative mind is actually like.</p>

<p>It’s also deeply reflective of the psychological theories of Carl Jung, who is <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref86" title="Friedrich Nietzsche, himself an influence on Jung, also had a hand. The first three aphorisms of Human, All Too Human discuss it, and indeed, Aphorism 1 (see footnote) ends with its literal translation (“opposite course”). He also discusses the idea in Beyond Good and Evil Aphorism 2, and arguably also in its more famous Aphorism 146 (“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee”).">largely responsible for repopularizing the concept of enantiodromia in the West.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt86" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8312;&#8310;&#8318;</a></span></span> “Hi Ren” is a deep examination both of enantiodromia and of another major Jungian concept, the shadow self. (Indeed, Ren closely paraphrases Jung in the song’s outro.)</p>

<p>The shadow is a repressed part of the personality that doesn’t correspond to the ideal self (ego ideal), leading to resistance of one’s own internal desires, psychological projection, and inner mental turmoil. While Freudian psychology thinks of the shadow as intrinsically negative, Jungian psychology does not: the Jungian shadow encompasses everything outside the light of consciousness, which can include positive aspects, especially in people struggling with anxiety, poor self-esteem, or false beliefs. (In fact, the Jungian shadow much more closely resembles the Freudian unconscious than the Freudian shadow.)</p>

<p>“Hi Ren” isn’t just a song, although it absolutely is that too. It’s a performance art, a short film, a one-man stage show. The visuals are inseparable from the narrative. The audio is an unspliced single-take recording, although the video was spliced together from four separate takes. (Ren most often does single-take videos, but he and his videographer Samuel Perry-Falvey didn’t have enough time on the video’s set to get a single take whose audio and video footage were both of sufficient quality. “Money Game” took them some 180 takes to get correct.)</p>

<p>“Hi Ren” is a back-and-forth between two sides of Ren’s personality. The first is his conscious self. The more cynical voice that responds is the shadow. At first, it seems like the shadow is completely wrong, is just bringing Ren down, and would be best shut out entirely. But as the shadow replies, <span class="toc-counter">“You gotta kill you if you wanna kill me.”</span></p>

<p>Midway through the song, a much more sinister voice with overtly satanic characteristics begins speaking. This is no longer Ren’s shadow; it is now the collective shadow. Although the shadow is cynical, uncharitable, and sarcastic, its motives are genuinely benevolent in that it’s trying to protect Ren from disappointment. There’s nothing benevolent about the collective shadow. Jung links it to dehumanization and hate crimes. In “Hi Ren”, it says, <span class="toc-counter">“I am sin with no rhyme or reason, sun of the morning, Lucifer, Antichrist, father of lies, Mephistopheles, truth in a blender, deceitful pretender, the banished avenger.”</span> And underpinning all this is the interval most commonly referred to as <em>diabolus in mūsicā</em> (“the devil in music”): the tritone.</p>

<p>But the song continues. Ren repeats the first few words of the song, but he changes the line <span class="toc-counter">“since my therapist told me I’m ill”</span> to <span class="toc-counter">“and I’ve spent half my life ill.”</span> This is not poetic license. He got Lyme disease from a tick bite as a teenager, and it was misdiagnosed until a few years ago. He’s still recovering from it.</p>

<p>I tried describing what follows this in text, but it felt like a woefully inadequate response to one of the most powerful moments of any work of art from the twenty-first century. I’m simply going to urge readers to watch it for themselves. However, the song has no ending. It reprises the song’s wordless opening, but the chord progression never resolves to the root, creating the sense that the events the song describes will continue indefinitely. But although there’s no music beyond this point, the video is two minutes from over. At this point, Ren stands up and delivers a fourth wall-breaking monologue, which I’m reprinting in its entirety.</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">
	<p>When I was seventeen years old, I shouted out into an empty room and to a blank canvas that I would defeat the forces of evil, and for the next ten years of my life, I suffered the consequences, with autoimmunity, illness, and psychosis.</p>

	<p>As I got older, I realised there were no real winners and no real losers in psychological warfare, but there were victims, and there were students. It wasn’t David versus Goliath; it was a pendulum eternally swaying from the dark to the light, and the more intensely that the light shone, the darker a shadow it cast.</p>
	
	<p>It was never really a battle for me to win. It was an eternal dance, and like a dance, the more rigid I became, the harder it got. The more I cursed my clumsy footsteps, the more I struggled. So I got older, and I learned to relax, and I learned to soften, and that dance got easier.</p>
	
	<p>It is this eternal dance that separates human beings from angels, from demons, from gods. And I must not forget, we must not forget, that we are human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This section undescores how much the entire song has been about enantiodromia. <span class="toc-counter">“The more intensely that the light shone, the darker a shadow it cast”</span> is paraphrased from Carl Jung, and the line about the pendulum in particular seems particularly pertinent here. The further the pendulum swings, the more intense the shifts get.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned before that people have a tendency to see themselves as the heroes of their own stories. I honestly view this as a mistake. We don’t think of heroes as flawed people. Real people have flaws. Being so determined to see ourselves as heroes makes it harder to see our own flaws, which in turn means we’re never going to correct those flaws.</p>

<p>Ren’s outlook strikes me as the correct one. We are not angels, we are not demons, and we are certainly not gods. Supernatural entities don’t get the kind of inner turmoil Ren describes here. We should neither expect perfection out of ourselves nor allow ourselves to be heartless monsters. As humans, we’re neither. We’re a mixture of both. And that’s beautiful in its own right.</p>

<p>If you open <em>Eternal</em>’s map in the map editor Weland, you’ll notice map writing on a lot of the levels, mostly in Latin (“Septococcal Pfhoryngitis”, “Dysmentria”, and “Enantiodromia” use Greek, since their titles are mostly or entirely derived from Greek words). Some of these are simply level design credits, but a lot of them are lengthy passages in Greek or Latin, followed by initials and dates. Most of these are translations of song lyrics. The last one for the game’s epilogue, “The Near Side of Everywhere” reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter" lang="lat">
	<p>Numquam verō erat proelium prō mē vincere. Erat saltātiō aeterna. Ac sicuti aliqua saltātiō, rigidor fi&shy;ē&shy;bam, difficilior saltātiō fiēbat. Magis exsecrābar vestigia inconcinna mea, magis lūctābar. Igitur ado&shy;lē&shy;scē&shy;bam, ac discēbam mollīre, ac illa saltātio fiēbat facilior.</p>
	
	<p>Est haec saltātiō aeterna quae dīvidit hominēs ab angelīs, ab daemonibus, ab dīs. Ac debeō nē oblīvīscī, debemus nē obliīvīscī, ut sumus hominēs.</p>
	<p><blockquote class="speaker">–<strong>RG</strong>, MMXXII</blockquote></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will probably surprise no one that this is a Latin translation of the last two paragraphs of Ren’s closing monologue. Given how closely his work tied in with some of our central themes, and how the very name of the game appears five different times in the song’s lyrics, I felt it essential to tie it in. In fact, <span class="toc-counter">«νῷν αἰωνίου χοροῦ»</span> (<span class="toc-counter">“our eternal dance”</span>) in “Vīdī rēs vōs hominēs nē crēderētis” is also a reference both to <em>Eternal</em> and to “Hi Ren”.</p>

<p>I recently translated the first two paragraphs of his monologue to Attic Greek. I’m less confident in the accuracy of this translation, but I still plan to include it in the map writing for “Enantiodromia” for the next release of the game.</p>

<p>“Hi Ren” is not Ren’s only song to address enantiodromia: the “Money Game” trilogy also addresses it at length, particularly in part three.

<p>It’s very difficult to talk about what makes the <em>Spider-Verse</em> films special without spoiling them. They are, bar none, the greatest comic book movies I have ever seen, and it’s not even a particularly close call. In part, this is because they are the only comic book movies I have ever seen that really feel like <em>comic books</em>. Their animation is genuinely revolutionary: Sony truly knocked it out of the park. The films fully embody comics’ diversity and beauty like nothing that came before them, and other studios are still trying to catch up. (There have been some good attempts, mind you; I’d name <em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em> as an example of a film that would never have been made before the <em>Spider-Verse</em> films, and is all the better for its influence. Also, hot take: <em>The Last Wish</em> is the best film in the <em>Shrek</em> franchise, and it’s not even particularly close.)</p>

<p>Might a major comic book film of this quality have centered primarily on a black protagonist and his family before <em>Moonlight</em>? Perhaps. But it’s difficult not to think that <em>Moonlight</em>’s success made it easier for such a film to get made, especially with two of the film’s three directors singing its praises or citing it as an influence.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#contents">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

<h3 class="centred" id="nimona"><em>Nimona</em></h3>

<p><em>Nimona</em>, the other film I wish to discuss, almost didn’t get released. In fact, Disney actually cancelled its production and closed down its production company, Blue Sky Studios, about six months before it was to be finished. If Annapurna Pictures hadn’t bought it out, it probably would never would have been. Three former Blue Sky staff members said Disney leadership had pushed back against the film’s queer themes and a same-sex kiss.</p>

<p>These were also a major part of the reason Annapurna acquired the film; its CEO Megan Ellison said, <span class="toc-counter">“I needed this movie when I was a kid, and quite frankly, I needed it right then and there.”</span> Ellison encouraged the filmmakers to embrace the film’s queer themes.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Spider-Verse</em>, I don’t have quotes from <em>Nimona</em>’s filmmakers explicitly stating that <em>Moonlight</em> was an influence, but there’s enough similarity in their approaches that I find it quite instructive to compare them. Shortly after seeing <em>Nimona</em>, I wrote the following text, which I’ve lightly edited, mostly by capitalizing words and redacting several spoilers. (A version with the spoilers is available <a href="nimonaspoilercommentary.html">here</a>.)</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">
	<p>I’ve been thinking a bit about why I immediately read the movie as implying a romantic subtext between Nimona and <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span>. I think a big part of it was the physical contact, but there’s also the fact that they serve as a foil to Ballister and Ambrosius. In particular, the latter two demonstrate the value of <em>listening</em> and ultimately extending trust, forgiveness, and understanding to one’s romantic partner, where the former two demonstrate the horrible things that can happen when one <em>doesn’t</em> do that.</p>

	<p>In the end, the one thing that I think really <em>doesn’t</em> work for me about the picture is that <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> is too young. Not only is she too young for romance, but she’s also young enough that <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span>. That said, the movie clearly presents Ballister/Ambrosius and Nimona/<span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> as foils, whether we read them as romantic or not. But while I would age <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> up, I think whether she and Nimona had a romantic relationship is more powerful if left as subtext: it’s one of those questions that doesn’t need to be resolved, and in such cases, I think it’s best to allow audiences to draw their own conclusions.</p>

	<p>Indeed, one thing I found especially powerful about <em>Nimona</em> was that it knew which questions it didn’t need to answer. “<em>What</em> is Nimona?” ultimately isn’t important, and leaving the answer up to interpretation was the right choice. Leaving the only element of her background <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> makes her story <em>more</em> powerful than it would be if we had any further answers. Are there more like her? It’s unclear, and I think the story is actually more powerful for that. Sometimes details can make a story more powerful, but sometimes their <em>omission</em> can make a story more universal. Knowing which is which is an important element of storytelling.</p>
		
	<p>This is one of several reasons <em>Nimona</em> reminded me of <em>Moonlight</em>, which, as I’m sure I’ve said <em>ad nauseam</em>, is my favorite film of all time. Both films shrewdly use details in ways that make their stories <em>more</em> universal, not less. Their narratives about alienation from society are another huge factor. Plus, of course, there’s both films’ queer themes, but it’s not just their presence, but also how neither really treats them as a Big Deal beyond their direct relevance to the characters’ lives, thus preventing either from feeling self-congratulatory. Queerness is just a natural part of life in both films, and neither draws undue attention to it.</p>

	<p>Of course, one important distinction between the two films’ handling of queerness is that <em>Moonlight</em> directly addresses characters being bullied <em>for</em> being queer, while <em>Nimona</em> at no point implies that that kind of thing even happens in the society it depicts. I think there are things to be said for each approach, and I think each film actually took the best approach possible for the audience it was trying to reach. (Also, <em>Nimona</em> being a fantasy and <em>Moonlight</em> being… not that no doubt ties into the appropriateness of each film’s approach.)</p>

	<p>In any case, <em>Nimona</em>’s same-sex relationships are not the sort that will make children uncomfortable. A lot of kids probably won’t even notice they’re romantic relationships, in fact; the film doesn’t draw any sort of attention to its characters’ sexuality at all. Its relationships are the sort that make <em>adults with certain worldviews</em> uncomfortable. Draw from that, and Disney’s response to it, what you will.</p>

<p>The list of films that could be said to bear <em>Moonlight</em>’s indirect influence is substantially longer. Might <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em>, and <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> have been made without <em>Moonlight</em>? Perhaps. <em>Get Out</em> was made the same year as <em>Moonlight</em>, after all, and even if it shares a lot of similar themes, it was a contemporary of <em>Moonlight</em>, not a successor.</p>

<h1 class="centred" id="baseball">On baseball</h1>
<h2 class="centred" id="congenitalbias">On my congenital bias against the Toronto Blue Jays</h2>

<p>I mostly don’t follow professional sports. I followed the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s, but I think I was mostly just a fan of that particular team. Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Toni Kukoč, and Robert Parish were poetry in motion. That team felt like the only equivalent of the 1920s Yankees’ “Murderer’s Row” I’d ever see in any sport: a candidate for the greatest player in the sport’s history, and several others who’d be any other team’s star player. All five players I mentioned are Hall of Famers, as is coach Phil Jackson. Until the 2024-2025 Los Angeles Dodgers rolled along, I never expected to see another team of that caliber in any sport.</p>

<p>But my first and greatest love among sports is and probably always will be baseball. I must preface all the following remarks by noting that I was born in Atlanta, Georgia. My understanding is that geneticists have isolated this as the key factor in congenital biases against both Game 7 of the 1991 World Series and the Toronto Blue Jays (who defeated the Atlanta Braves in 1992’s World Series). I will admit that objectively, 1991’s Game 7 (in which the Minnesota Twins defeated the Braves 1&ndash;0 in ten innings) <em>should</em> qualify as one of the best of all time, but I’m still not over it, and it will never, ever top my “greatest Game 7s of all time” list. (I’ve at least cooled down enough to place it in my top 10, even though I still hate the outcome.) Moreover, even if I weren’t an Atlanta native, familial loyalty would still obligate me to be a Braves fan: their star pitcher Chris Sale is my third cousin.</p>

<p>For some reason, though, I’ve mostly forgiven the Twins for 1991. I haven’t forgiven the Jays for 1992. I don’t think my dislike is really against the franchise per se. If anything, I gained a considerable amount of overall respect for the team for their performance in 2025’s World Series (aside from George Springer, whom I doubt I’ll ever forgive his role in the Astros’ sign-stealing). And to be clear, the majority of Jays fans have been handled a loss that must rival how 1991 felt to us Braves fans with unimaginable grace and class.</p>

<p>It is, as usual, a small but vocal minority of fans who ruin everyone else’s reputation. The reason the Twins escaped my long-time loathing, but the Jays didn’t, is largely due to the behavior of one particularly insufferable Canadian classmate in 1992 who seemed determined to disprove the stereotype that Canadians are polite. This was 33 years ago, so I’m not even going to attempt to recount memories of any particular incidents, which I’m sure are horrendously inaccurate. I’ll just note that I didn’t know the word <em>Backpfeifengesicht</em> (literally, “a face in need of a slap”: <em>of course</em> the Germans would have a word for this – not just an expression, a single word!) in 1992, but if I had, I’m sure I’d have used it to describe him. To be clear, I don’t condone unprovoked violence, but <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref88" title="If you’ve done the math, you’ll realize that, since I graduated from high school in 2001, I should’ve been in fourth grade in October 1992. The explanation is that I skipped a grade at the school I attended before Pine View. The next year, I started attending Pine View, and since its fifth-grade classes were the equivalent of other schools’ sixth grade, I opted to enroll as a fifth-grader. (Nonetheless, I ultimately wound up skipping a year in Spanish and two years in mathematics and programming.)">I was in fifth grade at the time,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt87" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8312;&#8311;&#8318;</a></span> and few things are more infuriating than a sore winner.</p>

<p>As I said, the majority of Jays fans this year really did nothing to earn my ire. However, I only saw signs personally attacking a specific player from one Major League Baseball franchise’s fans this season, and in case you need a hint which franchise that was, here it is: that franchise is not based in the United States. I’d still be more willing to forgive even this if they weren’t targeting one of the nicest, humblest, hardest-working athletes in the history of the sport, a legitimate contender for the greatest to ever do it, and a member of one of this country’s most vulnerable populations besides.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="ohtani">Why Shohei Ohtani may be the best baseball player of all time</h2>

<p>I’m referring, of course, to Shohei Ohtani, the closest baseball equivalent to Michael Jordan to have played the sport in my lifetime, an all-rounder of historically unprecedented caliber. Babe Ruth was known for being an excellent pitcher and an incredible home run hitter, but he mostly focused on pitching while with the Red Sox and on hitting while with the Yankees, and he was a middling baserunner who got worse as he aged. Ohtani has both hit and pitched fairly consistently despite occasional injuries, and is a superb baserunner besides. Only two players in Major League Baseball history have amassed single-season totals of both 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases: Ohtani and Aaron Judge. But Ohtani did Judge one better by doing both in the same season (2024).</p>

<p>Ohtani is also the first player in the modern era to have led his league in pitching, hitting, and baserunning statistics in a single season (2022): as a pitcher, he led the AL in strikeouts per innings pitched (11.87); as a hitter, he had the highest exit-velocity home run that season (111.9 mph); and as a baserunner, he led MLB with a home-to-first average time of 4.09 seconds. His awards include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>5x Major League Baseball All-Star (2021-2025)</li>
	<li>3x Silver Slugger Award at Designated Hitter (2021, 2023, 2024)</li>
	<li>2x American League Most Valuable Player (2021, 2023)</li>
	<li>American League Rookie of the Year (2018)</li>
	<li>National League Most Valuable Player (2024)</li>
	<li>National League Championship Series MVP (2025)</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s just a smattering of them. (Several of these awards are pending for 2025.) He has also led either the AL or NL (and sometimes all of Major League Baseball) in several important statistics in up to three seasons since 2021 (his first full year in MLB without any major injuries):</p>

<p>And bear in mind, injuries have curtailed his pitching over his time in MLB: if he avoids them in future years, who knows how much better he’ll get. But one further indication came in 2025’s National League Championship Series, when Ohtani became the first pitcher to hit a leadoff home run, the first player to hit three home runs and strike out ten batters in any single game, the first pitcher to hit multiple home runs in the same postseason game, and only the twelfth player ever to hit three home runs in the same postseason game. In short, it’s not exactly a hot take to say that Ohtani is a baseball player of historically unprecedented talent and skill.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#contents">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

<h2 class="centred" id="rootingwithoutjerkiness">How to root for a team without being a jerk to their opponents</h2>

<p>As a result, I get why Toronto fans are disappointed that he interviewed with their franchise and didn’t sign with them. You have every right to be. But taking it out on him is completely unfair. Ohtani had numerous reasons to sign with Los Angeles, starting with the mundane: Los Angeles has a much larger Japanese population than Toronto does, and when you’re immigrating to a completely different country with a completely different culture, doing everything you can to minimize your culture shock makes sense. Los Angeles probably has dozens more great sushi restaurants than Toronto has sushi restaurants total. I know that if I were moving to a European or Asian country, the ease of finding good barbecue and/or good Italian food would be a non-zero factor as to what city I might choose to move to (so, probably somewhere in Italy, then).</p>

<p>The Dodgers also already have experience dealing with Japanese players, and that’s a consideration of its own. He currently has two Japanese teammates, 2025 World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto (who made a strong case this postseason that he is the best active pitcher in Major League Baseball) and closer Roki Sasaki, and is very clearly good friends with both. The Blue Jays currently have no Japanese players.</p>

<p>The problem is that some of the signs I saw targeting on Ohtani didn’t <em>just</em> read as attacks on Ohtani. Ohtani may be one of the most successful athletes in history, but he’s also one of this country’s most visible and most respected representatives of one of its most marginalized populations: immigrants.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll be charitable and assume that the people waving signs along the lines of “We don’t need Ohtani” hadn’t fully thought out the broader implications. (Hanlon’s razor: Never assume malice where incompetence, ignorance, or stupidity serve as equally plausible explanations.) But when you’re targeting a member of a vulnerable group, even if that person is themselves immensely successful – maybe <em>especially</em> if that person is themselves immensely successful – it’s going to have a splash-back effect on other members of that group.</p>

<p>Think about the message such attacks send to our country’s other immigrants: it tells them that no matter how exceptional they are in their chosen field, <em>someone</em> will tell them, “We don’t need you.” That’s incredibly demoralizing. Part of the reason I was glad to see Los Angeles win the Series is because it explicitly proved that the people waving “We don’t need Ohtani” signs were objectively wrong.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="2025worldseries">2025: The greatest World Series of my lifetime</h2>

<p>In any case, neither Jays nor Dodgers fans should have any reason to feel let down by their teams’ respective performances in 2025: they gave us some of the most dramatic baseball any of us will ever see in our lifetimes, with some unbelievable and indeed historically unprecedented play by both teams. If I ever see another World Series to rival 2025’s, I will count myself lucky to do so, because I certainly don’t see how anything could. I find it weirdly ironic that the winning team is based in Los Angeles, because I can’t imagine how Hollywood could’ve scripted a more dramatic series, and especially a more dramatic finale.</p>

<p>For my money, a World Series needs several factors to qualify as truly great:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<p><strong>It must feature the two best teams in baseball.</strong> Ideally, this would happen every year, but it doesn’t always. For one thing, the two best teams may be in the same league, in which case, if we’re lucky, their League Championship Series will far outstrip the Series. If we’re unlucky, they’ll face off in one of the division or wild card races, and if we’re really unlucky, one of them will be eliminiated without facing the other. In any case, even if they’re not in the same league, sometimes one of the two best teams has a bad couple of nights, or maybe one or more of their most important players are out with injuries.</p>

		<p>Whatever the case, there’s absolutely no question that the best MLB franchises of 2025 were the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both teams have at least five almost certain future Hall of Fame inductees, and probably more than that. For my money, at least six current Dodgers are surefire inductees: Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Clayton Kershaw, Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. I didn’t follow Toronto’s season as closely, but I suspect Bo Bichette, Ernie Clement, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Alejandro Kirk, and (assuming he doesn’t have an early career-ending injury or otherwise fizzle out early) Trey Yesavage will make the Hall of Fame as well. (If skill were the only factor determining a player’s entrance into the Hall of Fame, George Springer would also be certain to get in, but he is so widely loathed for his role in the Astros’ sign-stealing that I don’t expect him to make it in during his lifetime.) A few others – </p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>The teams must be evenly matched in skill.</strong> If one team is vastly better than the other, the series turns into a blowout, and there’s never any doubt about who the winner will be.</li>

	<li>
		<p><strong>The teams must play exceptionally well.</strong> I don’t think there can be any realistic doubt that both Toronto and Los Angeles were firing on all cylinders. We can chalk up any perceived weaknesses in their playing to their opponents’ strengths. Ultimately, I think it’s fair to conclude that Toronto was stronger offensively, and Los Angeles was stronger defensively – and, at least in this series, defense outflanked offense.</p>
		
		<p>Both teams also had several exceptional pitchers, though the standouts on each side were clearly Los Angeles’ well-deserving MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Toronto’s rookie sensation Trey Yesavage. (I hope Atlanta can find another native of the planet that Yesavage must’ve been beamed down from – he seemingly came out of nowhere and was almost unhittable until Game Seven. The Yankees’ Cam Schlittler and the Brewers’ Jacob Misiorowski must be from the same planet.)</p>
		
		<p>Further credit is also due to Los Angeles reliever Will Klein, who earned a victory in Game Three for his four shutout innings with five strikeouts. Prior to that game, he had only pitched a single postseason inning (in Game 1), and his cumulative innings pitched in the MLB numbered at 22&frac23;. Despite Ohtani’s record-setting performance in that game, Freddie Freeman, who hit the game-winning home run, credited Klein as that game’s MVP without hesitation. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts also credited Klein and his fellow reliever Edgardo Henriquez for keeping the Dodgers alive from the thirteenth through eighteenth innings, saying after the game, <span class="toc-counter">“Tonight was Will Klein's night, and obviously, what Edgardo did was just as paramount.”</span></p>

		<p>It also happened that LA made several clutch plays at key moments of the series, and Roberts’ intuition was vindicated at almost every turn (this is a big advantage of having a former player for a manager):</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Roberts started Miguel Rojas in Game Six, even though he hadn’t had a hit since the start of the month. Game Six already vindicated him somewhat:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the bottom of the seventh inning, he made an exceptional bare-handed throw-out of Addison Barger at first base.</li>
					<li>In the bottom of the ninth, he completed an equally remarkable game-ending 7-4 double play.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>That was impressive enough. Then Game Seven happened:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rojas hit the game-tying home run in the top of the ninth, two outs away from elimination.</li>
					<li>in the bottom of the very same inning, Rojas made an equally clutch defensive play: he caught a ground ball at second and threw Isiah Kiner-Falefa out at home by a hair.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Few players have ever had more consequential innings.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Another of Roberts’ intuitions paid off on the very next play:
				<ul>
					<li>Immediately before Rojas’ clutch defensive play in Game Seven, Roberts had put Andy Pages in center field to replace Tommy Edman.</li>
					<li>Immediately after Rojas’ play, Pages caught a deep fly by Ernie Clement to end the enning.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Either team could have won this World Series. Against any other team in the opposing league, either team <em>would</em> have won this World Series. We should really be congratulating them both on their respective performances, because they gave us a World Series no baseball fan will soon forget.</p>
	</li>

	<li><strong>The series must go to seven games.</strong> In some ways, this is effectively a restatement of the previous two. If the teams aren’t evenly matched and/or don’t bring their A-games, we won’t get seven games.</li>

	<li><strong>At least one game must go to extra innings.</strong> 2025 had two: Games Three and Seven. Game Three went for a record-tying eighteen innings, which means that, in some senses, we should bump up the number of every game after Game Three, because eighteen innings of baseball qualifies as two baseball games. Nonetheless, I’ve followed the conventional numbering of Games One through Seven, and Game Seven <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc" target="_blank">went to eleven</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>At least one game before Game Seven must be an all-time classic.</strong> Of the six candidates, I consider Game Three the clear standout for its nail-biting relievers’ duel, which was one for the ages: both teams’ bullpens did not allow a single run from the eighth inning until the bottom of the eighteenth.</li>

	<li><strong>Several occurrences must be rare or unprecedented.</strong> Both teams gave us several. The Jays gave us:
		<ol class="lowerroman">
			<li>Addison Barger’s pinch-hit grand slam in Game One, the first in World Series history.</li>
			<li>The first back-to-back home runs to lead off a World Series game (by Davis Schneider and Guerrero, off Snell in Game Five).
			<li>Trey Yesavage’s otherworldly performance. His twelve strikeouts in Game Five made him the youngest player to strike out ten or more batters in a World Series game. He also became the first pitcher in history to start Low A, High A, Double A, Triple A, and World Series games in the same year.</li>
			<li>Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s exceptional postseason performance made him the all-time leader in postseason wRC (Weighted Runs Created), which measures a player’s total offensive production. Guerrero’s 25.3 outstrips the previous record-holder, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Randy Arozarena, who had 24.9 in 2020.</li>
			<li>Ernie Clement’s unprecedented 30 postseason hits and 14-game postseason hitting streak.</li>
			<li>Louis Varland’s unprecedented 15 postseason appearances as a pitcher.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Dodgers gave us:</p>

			<li>In Game Three, Shohei Ohtani set a new MLB postseason record by reaching base nine times in a single game, going four for four with three RBI, two walks, and five walks. This also makes him the fourth player ever to reach base nine times in <em>any</em> MLB game, and the first since Stan Hack in 1942. Ohtani also became only the second player to get four extra-base hits in a single postseason game, and the first since Frank Isbell in the 1906 World Series’ Game Five. His four intentional walks during that game also set a new World Series record.</li>
			<li>Freddie Freeman’s walkoff home run in Game Three made him the first player to hit walkoff home runs in two consecutive World Series (after a walkoff grand slam in 2024’s Game One).

			<li>Yoshinobu Yamamoto’s tireless, unflappable performance. By winning three games in a single World Series, he joins the elite company of Randy Johnson (2001); Yamamoto also became the first pitcher to have accomplished all three wins on the road. He’s the first pitcher ever to start and win Game Six, then record more outs in Game Seven than any other pitcher on their team. He’s also the first pitcher to throw a complete game in the World Series since the Royals’ Johnny Cueto in 2015, and the first to throw two consecutive postseason complete games since the Diamondbacks’ Curt Schilling in 2001. Moreover, he was warming up in the bullpen in Game Three when Freeman hit his walkoff home run. I’m fairly sure he’s from the same planet as Yesavage, Schlittler, and Misiorowski.</li>

(Most notably, he sang it before 2018’s eighteen-inning marathon; he also sang it before an eleven-inning 2017 game and a ten-inning 2024 game.) As an aside, I usually <em>hate</em> “The Star-Spangled Banner”, and I’m only lukewarm on modern country, but the two renditions I’ve truly enjoyed at sporting events have both been by country singers – Paisley’s and <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref89" title="Hot take: Chris Stapleton is a blues guitarist and blue-eyed soul singer who’s fooled everyone into thinking he’s a country singer by wearing a cowboy hat and living in Nashville. To be clear, I’m not dissing either Stapleton, who’s one of the most incredible singers and songwriters to have emerged in the last twenty years, or country music; I just hear much more blues and soul than country in Stapleton’s sound, and what country I do hear in his sound is 1970s country. He has, however, *written* a ton of songs for people who definitely *are* country singers.">Chris Stapleton’s legendary 2023 Super Bowl performance.</li>

Someday, it will also become only the fourth Game Seven featuring two Hall of Fame starters: 1991 (the Twins’ Jack Morris vs. the Braves’ John Smoltz), 1965 (the Dodgers’ Sandy Koufax vs. the Twins’ Jim Kaat), and 1926 (the Cardinals’ Jesse Haines vs. the Yankees’ Waite Hoyt) are the others.

	<li><p><strong>The final game must be a suitably dramatic finale.</strong> I can only imagine fifteen World Series finales being considered to outstrip 2025’s by any metric. They are, in chronological order:</p>
		<ol class="lowerroman">
			<li>1912: Boston Red Sox 3, New York Giants 2, 10 innings. (Technically, this was Game Eight, because Game Two was declared a tie owing to the fact that it was too dark to continue playing.)</li>
			<li>1924: Washington Senators 4, New York Giants 3, 12 innings.</li>
			<li>1925: Pittsburgh Pirates 9, Washington Senators 7.</li>
			<li>1926: St. Louis Cardinals 3, New York Yankees 2.</li>

		</ol>
		<p>Note that all but three of these were one-run games. 1965 gets bonus points for every single winning pitcher throwing a complete game, which had not happened since 1940 and has not happened since. But for my money, only 1924, 1960, 2001, and 2016 even come close to 2025, and 2016 might not had it not broken the Curse of the Billy Goat. The closest is probably 1960, which ended with Bill Mazeroski’s legendary walkoff home run, to date the only one in any World Series finale, and contained two other lead-shattering three-run shots, one of which is considered the most consequential play of all time (on which more below).</p>
	</li>

	<li><p><strong>The series must come down to the wire.</strong> This is essentially a corollary to #7. Ideally, the outcome must not be a foregone conclusion until the final play.</p>

		<p>There is a concept known as a <span class="weight4 petitecaps toc-counter">golden pitch</span> (incidentally, invented by Wade Kapszukiewicz, the current mayor of Toledo, Ohio) that refers to a baseball game in which the outcome of a single pitch could result in World Series rings for either team. By definition, a golden pitch must be thrown in inning 9 or later of a winner-take-all game, and the road team must have the lead. As a result, they are extremely rare. As of this year, only nine games have featured golden pitches, and not coincidentally, all eight other games appear on the preceding list, and all nine were one-run games. (Players on the winning teams are bolded.)</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseball-Reference.com</a> has a statistic called Championship Win Probability Added (cWPA), which calculates the probability a given play adds to a team’s chance of winning the World Series. The all-time leader of this stat is Hal Smith’s three-run blast in the bottom of the eighth in 1960’s World Series finale, which changed the score from NYY 7&ndash;PIT 6 to PIT 9&ndash;NYY 7 and gave the Pirates +63.6% cWPA. (That’s right: Mazeroski’s legendary walk-off home run <em>wasn’t</em> the game’s most consequential play. He hit his in a tie game, with cWP already around 50%; Smith hit his when the Pirates were a run behind, with four outs to close the gap.)</p>

		<p>Note that Yamamoto was the pitcher for four of these plays, although one counted against him: Guerrero’s double against him in the bottom of the eleventh (24.39%). The other three counted in his favor, giving him a cumulative +55.23% just between those four plays. (The three plays that counted in his favor sum up to 79.62%.) Toronto reliever Seranthony Domínguez is the only other player with multiple appearances on the above list (for two outs in the top of the tenth inning).</p>

		<p>Also, just look at the <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2025_WS.shtml#all_chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cWPA chart</a>’s insane volatility in the last three innings. The cWPA shifted 15% or more in nine different plays in 2025’s finale, eight of them in the final three innings. If that sounds unusual, that’s because it is: 1924’s Giants/Senators game, the previous record holder, had a mere seven such single-play shifts. Three games (1912 Game Eight, 1946 Game Six, and 1991 Game Six) are now tied for third with six, and another four (1960, 2001, 1997, and 1925’s finales) are tied for sixth with five.</p>
		
		<p>Bearing all that in mind, I feel confident that this isn’t recency bias: this really was the greatest World Series Game Seven ever played, and there’s a strong case for the whole series being the greatest ever as well.</p>

<h2 class="centred">Why it matters</h2>

<p>It’s easy to write off professional sports as <em class="toc-counter">panem et circenses</em> (<em class="toc-counter">bread and circuses</em>). I understand the argument, and in some cases, it almost seems true. But at their best, sports can be a lot more than that. For one thing, they can be a major driver of social change: think Jackie Robinson breaking baseball’s color barrier, or Muhammad Ali resisting the Vietnam War, or Roberto Clemente’s humanitarian work in Latin America and the Caribbean, or Magic Johnson’s AIDS activism. Clemente gives his name to Major League Baseball’s award for the athlete who “best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team”. Many athletes have also been instrumental in fights for civil rights. Mazeroski (yes, he of the sole World Series Game Seven walkoff home run in history) wrote that some sportswriters:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">“tried to make him look like an ass by getting him to say controversial things and then they wrote how the Puerto Rican hot dog was popping off again. … [W]riters who couldn't speak three words of Spanish tried to make him look silly, but he's an intelligent man who knows people and knows the game.”</blockquote>

<p>It’s also difficult to overstate the cultural impact of Hank Aaron shattering baseball’s home run record.

			<td>Friedrich Nietzsche, himself an influence on Jung, also had a hand. The first three aphorisms of <em>Human, All Too Human</em> discuss it, and indeed, Aphorism 1 ends with its literal translation:
				
				<blockquote class="toc-counter"><strong>Chemistry of the Notions and the Feelings.</strong>—Philosophical problems, in almost all their aspects, present themselves in the same interrogative formula now that they did two thousand years ago: how can a thing develop out of its antithesis? for example, the reasonable from the non-reasonable, the animate from the inanimate, the logical from the illogical, altruism from egoism, disinterestedness from greed, truth from error? The metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear of this difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of one thing from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemed highest and best, due to the very nature and being of the "thing-in-itself." The historical philosophy, on the other hand, which can no longer be viewed apart from physical science, the youngest of all philosophical methods, discovered experimentally (and its results will probably always be the same) that there is no antithesis whatever, except in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysical comprehension,[20] and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of such contradiction. According to its explanation, there is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?</blockquote>
				He also discusses the idea in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> Aphorism 2, and arguably also in its more famous Aphorism 146 (<span class="toc-counter">“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee”</span>).

			<td>If you’ve done the math, you’ll realize that, since I graduated from high school in 2001, I should’ve been in fourth grade in October 1992. The explanation is that I skipped a grade at the school I attended before Pine View. The next year, I started attending Pine View, and since its fifth-grade classes were the equivalent of other schools’ sixth grade, I opted to enroll as a fifth-grader. (Nonetheless, I ultimately wound up skipping a year in Spanish and two years in mathematics and programming.)</td>

			<td>Hot take: Chris Stapleton is a blues guitarist and blue-eyed soul singer who’s fooled everyone into thinking he’s a country singer by wearing a cowboy hat and living in Nashville. To be clear, I’m not dissing either Stapleton, who’s one of the most incredible singers and songwriters to have emerged in the last twenty years, or country music; I just hear much more blues and soul than country in Stapleton’s sound, and what country I do hear in his sound is 1970s country. He has, however, <em>written</em> a ton of songs for people who definitely <em>are</em> country singers.</td>
