<em class="accentlinks">[Note: For context, when this section is complete, it will immediately follow the section «<a href="moonlight.html#enokhroiselenofoti" lang="grc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline songlink">«Ε&#787;ν ὠχρῷ σελήνόφωτῐ́</a>»</a>. Thus, the “final stanza” it’s referring to is the Greek stanza of the lyrics near the end of that section.]</em>

<p>The final stanza is also inspired by <em>Eternal</em> (which in turn is heavily inspired by a secret message in <em>Marathon 2</em>’s level “Kill Your Television”). The line about justice and equality is a direct result of <em>Eternal</em>’s deep connection to Egyptian mythology: it includes characters named after the Egyptian deities Hathor, Bast(et), Sakhmet, and Apep; directly refers to several Egyptian myths; and is heavily influenced by the Egyptians’ concept of balance, which, as I shall explain, was arguably substantially more complex than our modern one.</p>

<p>Some of our labels end up generalizing heavily about human history. “Ancient Greece”, at the short end, refers to a timespan of about 750 years (Ischia’s settlement in 785 BCE to the Roman conquest in 31-30 BCE); the upper end of typical usage encompasses just under two millennia (Euboea’s rise ca. 1200 BCE to the second Arab siege of Constantinople in 717-718 CE), although one could argue that because Aegean Greece (3300 BCE) qualifies as both ancient and Greek, “ancient Greece” should properly encompass a span of <em>over four millennia</em>.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt is similar. Convention holds that it begins with the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt ca. 3150 BCE and ends with its annexation by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE. That’s over three millennia – more than half of recorded human history. Therefore, everything I’m about to write will, by necessity, be a broad generalization. Interpretations of Egyptian mythology varied widely over the course of its history.</p>

<p>I think Ancient Egypt gets something of a bad rap. The Book of Exodus may be partly to blame for this. (Modern scholars mostly consider its account to be largely ahistorical: archaeological evidence suggests the Israelites to have been largely indigenous to Canaan, with an at most small group being exiled Egyptians. The Torah’s narrative may contain an historical core in having been contributed by this group.) It should go without saying that slavery is an atrocity, but people seem to hold it against the Egyptians much more than they hold it against the Romans and Greeks. You’d almost forget that ‘ancilla’ comes from a Latin word for ‘slave-girl’.</p>

<p>In any case, by the time of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Egyptian law treated women much better than the Greeks or Romans did at the time, allowing them substantial independence and freedom to own property. This eventually influenced Greek and Roman law. To some degree, Egypt’s more progressive stance on women’s rights is also reflected in its pantheon, whose goddesses include some of mythology’s most fascinating, multifaceted characters.</p>

<p>That said, Egyptian mythology was less concerned with good and evil than with order and chaos. This isn’t to say Egypt didn’t have benevolent or malevolent deities. Contrary to popular belief, far and away their pantheon’s most malevolent deity was Apep, who might, in fact, be the most malevolent deity in <em>any</em> major pantheon. How many other deities throughout history have people prayed <em>against</em>? I literally can’t think of any.</p>

<p>Apep was the living embodiment of the phrase “chaotic evil”; his epithets included “Lord of Chaos”. He resented reality’s very existence and therefore sought to unmake it; the Egyptians believed the sun went down because Ra had to fight Apep <em>every night</em> to stop him from doing so.</p>

<p>Since the Greeks renamed much of the Egyptian pantheon, you may also know Apep as Apophis. Besides (possibly) Sobek, Bastet, and Apep, the Greek names are now better known: <em>Thoth</em>, <em>Osiris</em>, <em>Isis</em>, and <em>Anubis</em> are far more recognizable than <em>Djehuti</em>, <em>Wesir</em>, <em>Aset</em>, or <em>Inepu</em>. That said, a few of the names didn’t change:</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="pantesturannoi">«Πᾰ́ντες τῠ́ρᾰννοι οͅφείλωσῐ δείσειν»</h3>

<p>Speaking of Ma’at, she’s the main reason I’m discussing Egyptian mythology in such detail.</p>

<p>Ma’at is often characterized as the Egyptian goddess of order. This isn’t technically <em>wrong</em>, but, like many popular beliefs about Ancient Egypt, it’s also not the full picture. Ma’at was both a deity and an ideological concept. Isfet, her ideological opposite, wasn’t a deity and was instead personified by Apep (Ma’at’s theological opposite, to absolutely no one’s surprise). This is only natural: chaos is, of course, order’s opposite.</p>

<p>However, Ma’at wasn’t merely the goddess of order. She was also the goddess of balance, justice, reciprocity, harmony, ethics, and truth. And my reading is that, even more importantly, the Egyptians considered these concepts inseparable: to them, a fundamentally unjust or imbalanced society was <em>by definition</em> not an ordered society.</p>

<p>(I apologize if this gets confusing, by the way: we’re discussing ancient Egyptian concepts that don’t map exactly to English words, so my descriptions will be at best imprecise.)</p>

<p>I already mentioned that Apep is effectively the embodiment of chaotic evil. Let’s extend the <em>D&D</em> metaphor further. Ma’at is sometimes categorized as lawful good, but since she’s the goddess of balance, I think neutral good is a much better fit. Lawful good can lend itself to fanaticism.</p>

<p>I didn’t have to play <em>D&D</em> for long before I realized how much easier it is in practice to be neutral good than to be either lawful good or chaotic good. The latter two require consistent conformity to rigid behavior patterns that may not actually be pragmatic ways to accomplish the most good. Chaotic good characters might be unable to work within the system when doing so affords them greater abilities to create positive outcomes. Lawful good characters might be unable to work outside systems when they prove inflexible and resistant to actions needed to help or protect people. In fact, such characters might not even be able to <em>consider</em> such courses of action. Neutral good affords players the ability not just to <em>consider</em> both, but to <em>do</em> both.</p>

<p>In short, neutral good is the logical choice for any player seeking to provide the greatest good to the greatest number. <em>D&D</em> doesn’t reflect reality in every possible manner, but in this regard, I feel it’s quite on point.</p>

<p>If Ma’at, as the goddess of balance, is neutral good, then it follows that chaotic evil cannot be her only opposite. Lawful evil – in other words, tyranny – must be just as much her opposite.</p>

<p>This actually seems to reflect the Egyptians’ view. While they contrasted order with chaos, they also contrasted it with tyranny. But they also don’t appear to have seen tyranny and chaos as synonyms. And this is one place where I don’t think D&D maps precisely to reality.</p>

<p>We see order and chaos as a linear spectrum, but if the Egyptians saw order as <em>balance</em>, then they’d logically also see it as lying <em>between</em> two undesirable extremes. We often see opposites as points on two opposite sides of a circle or spectrum. But Ma’at is more accurately seen as the <em>center</em> of a circle or spectrum, and her opposites as points on either side.</p>

<p>The extreme on the other side of chaos can be seen as false order, as artificially imposed order, as law without justice, or simply as tyranny. It’s what a ruler attempts to impose upon subjects without actually solving their problems – without the actual <em>work</em> of governing. Thus, tyranny is as much an opposite of order as chaos is.</p>

<p>Although this doesn’t encompass all nine possible alignments in D&D, the Egyptian spectrum might be thought of as encompassing seven of them, wherein the closer you are to 0, the better:</p>

<ol start="-3">
	<li>Chaotic evil</li>
	<li>Chaotic neutral</li>
	<li>Chaotic good</li>
	<li>Neutral good</li>
	<li>Lawful good</li>
	<li>Lawful neutral</li>
	<li>Lawful evil</li>
</ol>

<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#contents">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

<h3 class="centred" id="onedeprived">“One deprived becomes an opponent”</h3>

<p>The principles of Ma’at, as written in <em>The Instructions of Ptahhotep</em>, called the rich and powerful to help those less fortunate than themselves rather than to exploit them:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Be generous as long as you live.<br />
What leaves the storehouse does not return;<br />
It is the food to be shared which is coveted.<br />
One whose belly is empty is an accuser;<br />
One deprived becomes an opponent.<br />
Don’t have him for a neighbor.<br />
Kindness is a man’s memorial<br />
For the years after the function.</blockquote>

<p>In short, the most important principle is to treat others benevolently and kindly. But to the Egyptians, the above passage was also a practical argument. Remember, they believed that for a person’s immortal soul to reach the afterlife, their corpse must be properly cared for – they considered mummification, buried goods, and funerary incantations necessary to preserve <em>ka</em>, the vital force within the soul. Without proper care, the deceased could suffer damnation to a realm of fire, chaos, and conflict (so, the Christian hell in all but name). This made proper care of their memorials or tombs a matter of paramount importance to them. So effectively, the above excerpt is a carrot-and-stick appeal to rich people’s pragmatism:</p>
<ol>
	<li class="toc-counter weight3"><span class="petitecaps">Stick:</span> <span class="maincolor light">Fail to feed the hungry, and they’ll become unruly and rebellious.</span></li>
	<li class="toc-counter weight3"><span class="petitecaps">Carrot:</span> <span class="maincolor light">Feed them, and they’ll safeguard your immortal soul after you depart the mortal plane.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="margintop16">In another text, <em>The Tale of the Eloquent Peasant</em>, an officer, under the king’s direction, confiscates a nobleman’s wealth and gives it to a peasant the nobleman had abused. A third text says that a ruler who follows Ma’at:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">educates the ignorant to wisdom,<br />
and those who are unloved become as those who are loved.<br />
He causes the lesser folk to emulate the great:<br />
the last become as the first.<br />
He who was lacking possessions is (now) the possessor of riches.</blockquote>

<p>And <em>The Moaning of the Bedouin</em>, a popular tale from the Middle Kingdom, said that:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Those who destroy the lie promote Ma'at;<br />
those who promote the good will erase the evil.<br />
As fullness casts out appetite,<br />
as clothes cover the nude, and<br />
as heaven clears up after a storm.</blockquote>

<p>Ma’at held that the spirit of justice was more important than the letter of the law. Egyptian rulers were held to high standards: the Egyptians believed rulers’ failure to act impartially and justly could cause a famine. Egyptian citizens were expected to act truthfully and honorably in their daily lives within all familial, communal, national, environmental, and religious matters.</p>

<p>Ma’at was also a close analogue of (and may even have inspired) St. Peter: in the afterlife, she would weigh the good a person had done against the ill they had done. Those who had done more good would go to the afterlife; those who had done more ill would have their hearts devoured by Ammit, and their consciousness would effectively cease to exist entirely.</p>

<p>This is an interesting contrast with Christianity, especially since I’ve already compared its hell to the Egyptian concept of damnation. The Egyptians believed you couldn’t even reach the point of judgement if your corpse wasn’t properly cared for – if you annoyed people badly enough, it wouldn’t matter how much good you’d done. Meanwhile, if people saw you as worthy enough to care for your mortal soul, but you hadn’t done enough good to outweigh your misdeeds, you just ceased to exist.</p>

<p>I’m not calling this <em>better</em> than the Christian afterlife, mind you. Nor am I calling it worse. It’s just different.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="vacuumofbalance">“Nature resists even a vacuum of balance”</h3>

<p>One of <em>Eternal</em>’s central themes is that both extreme order and extreme chaos are destructive and undesirable. If you have even a slight interest in playing it, you may wish to skip to “The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone”, but I’ll try to avoid spoiling anything more than the broad strokes of the plot.</p>

<p>The backstory involves a chaotic evil being (which is, not coincidentally, nicknamed Apep, although its true name is never revealed) and a lawful evil faction that increasingly resemble each other as the story progresses. In fact, while they purport to be at war with each other, we deliberately left it open to interpretation how true this is.</p>

<p>Apep wants to destroy the galaxy for not entirely comprehensible reasons. He claims to have come from the galaxy’s original timeline, and wants to destroy it so he can restore the original timeline. Of course, that’s not how it works. If Apep is truly that powerful, he should be able to just travel back to his timeline. We imply that Apep has Seen Things You People Wouldn’t Believe and has been left a bit less than fully rational. (Reflecting this, his sole message to the player switches between Early Modern English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Hungarian, Latin, Attic Greek, and Japanese, for no apparent reason.)</p>

<p>The lawful evil faction is dead-set on preserving history exactly as it occurred – the exact history that gave them their powers. (I’m sure it’s just coincidence; what tyrants in history have ever had selfish motives?) Unfortunately, that history <em>ends</em> when Apep destroys the galaxy. The lawful evil faction just <em>doesn’t care</em> because, by this time, they’ve escaped our reality. The AI Durandal-Thoth, one of the player’s main allies, thus writes in the game’s closing message that the lawful evil faction:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">may consider themselves Apep’s opponents in theory; but their rigid fealty to a timeline in which the galaxy is destroyed gives that vengeful demon exactly what it wants, thus making them in practice stronger allies than it could ever have dreamt of. Failing to understand this is their tragic irony; perhaps they lack the needed self-awareness, but whatever the cause, it thus falls upon us to oppose both.
	<blockquote class="speaker">–<strong class="petitecaps">Durandal-Thoth</strong>, “The Near Side of Everywhere”</blockquote></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Durandal-Thoth also calls the lawful evil faction <span class="toc-counter">“hardly distinguishable from”</span> Apep, adding:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Call it enantiodromia, if you must: in the absence of balance, forces may become their very own equal and opposite reactions. Nature resists even a vacuum of balance.

<em>Enantiodromia</em> (Greek: <em>ἐναντῐοδρομία</em>) means <em>running contrarily</em> or <em>opposite running course</em>; it is a composite of <em>ἐνᾰντῐ́ος</em> (<em>enănti&#774;&#769;os</em>, <em>opposite</em>) and <em>δρόμος</em> (<em>drómos</em>, <em>racetrack</em>). The Macedonian anthologist Johannes Stobaeus (Greek: <em>Ἰωάννης ὁ Στοβαῖος</em>, <em>Iōánnēs ho Stobaíos</em>, literally <em>John the Stobian</em>) apparently invented it to describe a concept of the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus (<em>Ἡράκλειτος</em>, <em>Hērákleitos</em>), who wrote, <span class="toc-counter">“Cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry, and parched things get wet.”</span></p>

<p>A related concept within Heraclitus’ writings was the unity of opposites, expressed in its successive form in the above quote and in its compresent form in his aphorism, <span class="toc-counter">“The road up and the road down are the same thing.”</span> To Heraclitus, the only constant was change itself, which created a unity of opposites in that the universe simultaneously contained difference and sameness. In short, opposites are connected by their relationship to each other: hot and cold, pleasure and pain, moisture and dryness, are defined in relation to each other.</p>

<p>The important point is that, in the absence of balance, things turn into their opposites especially often. Another character in <em>Eternal</em> (I’m omitting her identity because it’s a major spoiler) writes:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">Ma’at comes from living in harmony with nature and with each other, from being benevolent and kind, from being honourable and truthful, from alleviating the suffering of those less fortunate than us rather than exploiting their misfortune. Order cannot exist without balance or justice, and trying too hard to impose it results in chaos, just as trying too hard to fit a square peg into a round hole breaks the peg.

<p>Of the game’s two villainous factions, she adds:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter"><p>Protest as they might, their clash is not a fundamental philosophical disagreement, but a mere fight to emerge atop a hierarchy. Both take as granted that in-groups will be protected but not bound by the law, and that out-groups will be bound but not protected by it. They are merely fighting to be the in-group. They may see each other as opposites, but they are merely two shades of tyranny.</p>

<p>The logical counterproposal, of course, is that the law must equally both protect and bind <em>everyone</em>, including leaders. No leader can truly embody the balance or justice of Ma’at unless bound by the law.

<h3 class="centred" id="wilhoit">“The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone”</h3>

<p>Most of the above <em>Eternal</em> quotes are my own words, but the line about in-groups and the counterproposal both paraphrase a now widely quoted comment that composer Frank Wilhoit (whom I acknowledge as an influence in the game’s secret credit terminal) posted to the website Crooked Timber on 2018-03-22. I consider it thought-provoking enough to quote it here in its entirety:</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter"><p>There is no such thing as liberalism — or progressivism, etc.</p>

<p>There is only conservatism. No other political philosophy actually exists; by the political analogue of Gresham’s Law, conservatism has driven every other idea out of circulation.</p>

<p>There might be, and should be, anti-conservatism; but it does not yet exist. What would it be? In order to answer that question, it is necessary and sufficient to characterize conservatism. Fortunately, this can be done very concisely.</p>
	
<p>Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit:</p>

<p>There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.</p>

<p>There is nothing more or else to it, and there never has been, in any place or time.</p>

<p>For millennia, conservatism had no name, because no other model of polity had ever been proposed. “The king can do no wrong.” In practice, this immunity was always extended to the king’s friends, however fungible a group they might have been. Today, we still have the king’s friends even where there is no king (dictator, etc.). Another way to look at this is that the king is a faction, rather than an individual.</p>

<p>As the core proposition of conservatism is indefensible if stated baldly, it has always been surrounded by an elaborate backwash of pseudophilosophy, amounting over time to millions of pages. All such is axiomatically dishonest and undeserving of serious scrutiny. Today, the accelerating de-education of humanity has reached a point where the market for pseudophilosophy is vanishing; it is, as The Kids Say These Days, tl;dr. All that is left is the core proposition itself — backed up, no longer by misdirection and sophistry, but by violence.</p>

<p>So this tells us what anti-conservatism must be: the proposition that the law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone, and cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</p>

<p>Then the appearance arises that the task is to map ‘liberalism’, or ‘progressivism’, or ‘socialism’, or whateverthefuckkindofstupidnoise-ism, onto the core proposition of anti-conservatism.</p>

<p>No, it a’n’t. The task is to throw all those things on the exact same burn pile as the collected works of all the apologists for conservatism, and start fresh. The core proposition of anti-conservatism requires no supplementation and no exegesis. It is as sufficient as it is necessary. What you see is what you get:</p>

<p><strong><em>The law cannot protect anyone unless it binds everyone; and it cannot bind anyone unless it protects everyone.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t agree with every word Wilhoit writes here, but I don’t <em>need</em> to, just as I don’t care if others self-identify as anarchist or socialist or liberal or progressive or Marxist or syndicalist or mutualist or libertarian or Burkean, or even conservative, for that matter. I think he’s oversimplifying, at least if people like Edmund Burke qualify as conservatives. (Wilhoit may well be right about the debased modern political ideology that now calls itself conservatism.) Nonetheless, his core proposition is ultimately the core of every important point to be made about politics: the law is fundamentally unjust unless it binds and protects everyone.</p>

<p>I’d take it a step further, in fact. I’d phrase it in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>The law is fundamentally unjust unless it binds and protects everyone exactly no more and exactly less than it binds and protects everyone else.</em></strong></blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, we leave ourselves open to <span class="toc-counter">“All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others”</span>-type loophole abuse. My other political principles all stem directly from that core proposition, and if you can agree with it, I’m sure we can find plenty of common ground. (Burke might even agree, since, as you may recall, he wrote, <span class="toc-counter">“Liberty, if I understand it at all, is a <em>general</em> principle, and the clear right of all the subjects within the realm, or of none,”</span> and, <span class="toc-counter">“Nothing is security to any individual but the common interest of all.”</span>)</p>

<p>In short, if the law does not obey the principles of Ma’at, it is not just. Wrapped up in the entire concept of Ma’at, in fact, is the idea that the spirit of justice supersedes the letter of the law.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="thedarkerashadow">“The more intensely that the light shone, the darker a shadow it cast”</h3>

<p>One of the profoundest statements on mental health I’ve encountered is by the Welsh musician Ren Aryn Gill, who most frequently uses his given name as a mononym. His song “Hi Ren” has been called this century’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”, which I think might actually be underselling it in some ways. It’s not actually as musically intricate as Queen’s masterpiece, but Ren also performed it live rather than constructing it in the studio. Moreover, it says things about mental health that I’ve rarely seen anyone acknowledge. It’s the most complete depiction I’ve ever seen of what the creative mind is actually like.</p>

<p>It’s also deeply reflective of the psychological theories of Carl Jung, who is <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref86" title="Friedrich Nietzsche, himself an influence on Jung, also had a hand. The first three aphorisms of Human, All Too Human discuss it, and indeed, Aphorism 1 (see footnote) ends with its literal translation (“opposite course”). He also discusses the idea in Beyond Good and Evil Aphorism 2, and arguably also in its more famous Aphorism 146 (“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee”).">largely responsible for repopularizing the concept of enantiodromia in the West.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#ftnt86" class="normal weight3 noprintlink">&#8317;&#8312;&#8310;&#8318;</a></span></span> “Hi Ren” is a deep examination both of enantiodromia and of another major Jungian concept, the shadow self. (Indeed, Ren closely paraphrases Jung in the song’s outro.)</p>

<p>The shadow is a repressed part of the personality that doesn’t correspond to the ideal self (ego ideal), leading to resistance of one’s own internal desires, psychological projection, and inner mental turmoil. While Freudian psychology thinks of the shadow as intrinsically negative, Jungian psychology does not: the Jungian shadow encompasses everything outside the light of consciousness, which can include positive aspects, especially in people struggling with anxiety, poor self-esteem, or false beliefs. (In fact, the Jungian shadow much more closely resembles the Freudian unconscious than the Freudian shadow.)</p>

<p>“Hi Ren” isn’t just a song, although it absolutely is that too. It’s a performance art, a short film, a one-man stage show. The visuals are inseparable from the narrative. The audio is an unspliced single-take recording, although the video was spliced together from four separate takes. (Ren most often does single-take videos, but he and his videographer Samuel Perry-Falvey didn’t have enough time on the video’s set to get a single take whose audio and video footage were both of sufficient quality. “Money Game” took them some 180 takes to get correct.)</p>

<p>“Hi Ren” is a back-and-forth between two sides of Ren’s personality. The first is his conscious self. The more cynical voice that responds is the shadow. At first, it seems like the shadow is completely wrong, is just bringing Ren down, and would be best shut out entirely. But as the shadow replies, <span class="toc-counter">“You gotta kill you if you wanna kill me.”</span></p>

<p>Midway through the song, a much more sinister voice with overtly satanic characteristics begins speaking. This is no longer Ren’s shadow; it is now the collective shadow. Although the shadow is cynical, uncharitable, and sarcastic, its motives are genuinely benevolent in that it’s trying to protect Ren from disappointment. There’s nothing benevolent about the collective shadow. Jung links it to dehumanization and hate crimes. In “Hi Ren”, it says, <span class="toc-counter">“I am sin with no rhyme or reason, sun of the morning, Lucifer, Antichrist, father of lies, Mephistopheles, truth in a blender, deceitful pretender, the banished avenger.”</span> And underpinning all this is the interval most commonly referred to as <em>diabolus in mūsicā</em> (“the devil in music”): the tritone.</p>

<p>But the song continues. Ren repeats the first few words of the song, but he changes the line <span class="toc-counter">“since my therapist told me I’m ill”</span> to <span class="toc-counter">“and I’ve spent half my life ill.”</span> This is not poetic license. He got Lyme disease from a tick bite as a teenager, and it was misdiagnosed until a few years ago. He’s still recovering from it.</p>

<p>He continues defiantly, <span class="toc-counter">“Some people know me as hope / Some people know me as the voice that you hear when you loosen the noose on the rope.”</span> I’ve heard this song hundreds of times. I rarely have dry eyes here.</p>

<p>Ren has been in a wheelchair this entire song, and at this point, he stands up. <span class="toc-counter">“And you know how I know that I’ll prosper? Because I stand here beside you today.”</span> I swear I must have some kind of allergy. Or there are ninjas chopping onions nearby. It’s gotta be the onion ninjas.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="moonlightsimpact"><em>Moonlight</em>’s impact on cinema and culture</h2>

<p>As I expected, <em>Moonlight</em> has had a major impact on cinema. I’m not sure if it exceeds or <span class="dotted" title="That is too a word, and if it isn’t, it should be.">subceeds</span> my expectations, but I certainly <em>didn’t</em> predict that its most obvious spiritual successors would be animated films.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can’t talk about any of these films in more than broad strokes without spoiling a large part of what makes them great. All of them have some pretty significant plot twists that are a major part of their power as films. As a result, I’m going to leave some things out of this analysis that I really want to talk about.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="spider-verse"><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> and <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em></h3>

<p>The most obvious examples are <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> and its sequel <em>Across the Spider-Verse</em>. Co-director Peter Ramsey called <em>Moonlight</em> <span class="toc-counter">“the most sensitive and emotionally powerful film I’ve seen in decades.”</span> It’s no coincidence that <em>Spider-Verse</em> also stars Mahershala Ali; co-director Bob Persichetti noted:<p>
	
	<blockquote class="toc-counter">We had just seen him in <em>Moonlight</em> and how he related to the young kid; we saw a lot of parallels. We approached Mahershala about playing the role of Aaron, never thinking he would actually be interested in doing it. We gave a whole presentation and pitch to him and he said “Yes” there and then. His agent was there and was shocked that he was saying yes on the spot.

<p>It’s very difficult to talk about what makes the <em>Spider-Verse</em> films special without spoiling them. They are, bar none, the greatest comic book movies I have ever seen, and it’s not even a particularly close call. In part, this is because they are the only comic book movies I have ever seen that really feel like <em>comic books</em>. Their animation is genuinely revolutionary: Sony truly knocked it out of the park. The films fully embody comics’ diversity and beauty like nothing that came before them, and other studios are still trying to catch up. (There have been some good attempts, mind you; I’d name <em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em> as an example of a film that would never have been made before the <em>Spider-Verse</em> films, and is all the better for its influence. Also, hot take: <em>The Last Wish</em> is the best film in the <em>Shrek</em> franchise, and it’s not even particularly close.)</p>

<p>Might a major comic book film of this quality have centered primarily on a black protagonist and his family before <em>Moonlight</em>? Perhaps. But it’s difficult not to think that <em>Moonlight</em>’s success made it easier for such a film to get made, especially with two of the film’s three directors singing its praises or citing it as an influence.</p>

<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#contents">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="portfolio.html">My portfolio</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

<h3 class="centred" id="nimona"><em>Nimona</em></h3>

<p><em>Nimona</em>, the other film I wish to discuss, almost didn’t get released. In fact, Disney actually cancelled its production and closed down its production company, Blue Sky Studios, about six months before it was to be finished. If Annapurna Pictures hadn’t bought it out, it probably would never would have been. Three former Blue Sky staff members said Disney leadership had pushed back against the film’s queer themes and a same-sex kiss.</p>

<p>These were also a major part of the reason Annapurna acquired the film; its CEO Megan Ellison said, <span class="toc-counter">“I needed this movie when I was a kid, and quite frankly, I needed it right then and there.”</span> Ellison encouraged the filmmakers to embrace the film’s queer themes.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Spider-Verse</em>, I don’t have quotes from <em>Nimona</em>’s filmmakers explicitly stating that <em>Moonlight</em> was an influence, but there’s enough similarity in their approaches that I find it quite instructive to compare them. Shortly after seeing <em>Nimona</em>, I wrote the following text, which I’ve lightly edited, mostly by capitalizing words and redacting several spoilers. (A version with the spoilers is available <a href="nimonaspoilercommentary.html">here</a>.)</p>

<blockquote class="toc-counter">
	<p>I’ve been thinking a bit about why I immediately read the movie as implying a romantic subtext between Nimona and <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span>. I think a big part of it was the physical contact, but there’s also the fact that they serve as a foil to Ballister and Ambrosius. In particular, the latter two demonstrate the value of <em>listening</em> and ultimately extending trust, forgiveness, and understanding to one’s romantic partner, where the former two demonstrate the horrible things that can happen when one <em>doesn’t</em> do that.</p>

	<p>In the end, the one thing that I think really <em>doesn’t</em> work for me about the picture is that <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> is too young. Not only is she too young for romance, but she’s also young enough that <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span>. That said, the movie clearly presents Ballister/Ambrosius and Nimona/<span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> as foils, whether we read them as romantic or not. But while I would age <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> up, I think whether she and Nimona had a romantic relationship is more powerful if left as subtext: it’s one of those questions that doesn’t need to be resolved, and in such cases, I think it’s best to allow audiences to draw their own conclusions.</p>

	<p>Indeed, one thing I found especially powerful about <em>Nimona</em> was that it knew which questions it didn’t need to answer. “<em>What</em> is Nimona?” ultimately isn’t important, and leaving the answer up to interpretation was the right choice. Leaving the only element of her background <span class="maincolor">[SPOILER]</span> makes her story <em>more</em> powerful than it would be if we had any further answers. Are there more like her? It’s unclear, and I think the story is actually more powerful for that. Sometimes details can make a story more powerful, but sometimes their <em>omission</em> can make a story more universal. Knowing which is which is an important element of storytelling.</p>
		
	<p>This is one of several reasons <em>Nimona</em> reminded me of <em>Moonlight</em>, which, as I’m sure I’ve said <em>ad nauseam</em>, is my favorite film of all time. Both films shrewdly use details in ways that make their stories <em>more</em> universal, not less. Their narratives about alienation from society are another huge factor. Plus, of course, there’s both films’ queer themes, but it’s not just their presence, but also how neither really treats them as a Big Deal beyond their direct relevance to the characters’ lives, thus preventing either from feeling self-congratulatory. Queerness is just a natural part of life in both films, and neither draws undue attention to it.</p>

	<p>Of course, one important distinction between the two films’ handling of queerness is that <em>Moonlight</em> directly addresses characters being bullied <em>for</em> being queer, while <em>Nimona</em> at no point implies that that kind of thing even happens in the society it depicts. I think there are things to be said for each approach, and I think each film actually took the best approach possible for the audience it was trying to reach. (Also, <em>Nimona</em> being a fantasy and <em>Moonlight</em> being… not that no doubt ties into the appropriateness of each film’s approach.)</p>

	<p>In any case, <em>Nimona</em>’s same-sex relationships are not the sort that will make children uncomfortable. A lot of kids probably won’t even notice they’re romantic relationships, in fact; the film doesn’t draw any sort of attention to its characters’ sexuality at all. Its relationships are the sort that make <em>adults with certain worldviews</em> uncomfortable. Draw from that, and Disney’s response to it, what you will.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="more">Other Films</h3>

<p>The list of films that could be said to bear <em>Moonlight</em>’s indirect influence is substantially longer. Might <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em>, and <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> have been made without <em>Moonlight</em>? Perhaps. <em>Get Out</em> was made the same year as <em>Moonlight</em>, after all, and even if it shares a lot of similar themes, it was a contemporary of <em>Moonlight</em>, not a successor.</p>

			<td>Friedrich Nietzsche, himself an influence on Jung, also had a hand. The first three aphorisms of <em>Human, All Too Human</em> discuss it, and indeed, Aphorism 1 ends with its literal translation:
				
				<blockquote class="toc-counter"><strong>Chemistry of the Notions and the Feelings.</strong>—Philosophical problems, in almost all their aspects, present themselves in the same interrogative formula now that they did two thousand years ago: how can a thing develop out of its antithesis? for example, the reasonable from the non-reasonable, the animate from the inanimate, the logical from the illogical, altruism from egoism, disinterestedness from greed, truth from error? The metaphysical philosophy formerly steered itself clear of this difficulty to such extent as to repudiate the evolution of one thing from another and to assign a miraculous origin to what it deemed highest and best, due to the very nature and being of the "thing-in-itself." The historical philosophy, on the other hand, which can no longer be viewed apart from physical science, the youngest of all philosophical methods, discovered experimentally (and its results will probably always be the same) that there is no antithesis whatever, except in the usual exaggerations of popular or metaphysical comprehension,[20] and that an error of the reason is at the bottom of such contradiction. According to its explanation, there is, strictly speaking, neither unselfish conduct, nor a wholly disinterested point of view. Both are simply sublimations in which the basic element seems almost evaporated and betrays its presence only to the keenest observation. All that we need and that could possibly be given us in the present state of development of the sciences, is a chemistry of the moral, religious, aesthetic conceptions and feeling, as well as of those emotions which we experience in the affairs, great and small, of society and civilization, and which we are sensible of even in solitude. But what if this chemistry established the fact that, even in its domain, the most magnificent results were attained with the basest and most despised ingredients? Would many feel disposed to continue such investigations? Mankind loves to put by the questions of its origin and beginning: must one not be almost inhuman in order to follow the opposite course?</blockquote>
				He also discusses the idea in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> Aphorism 2, and arguably also in its more famous Aphorism 146 (<span class="toc-counter">“He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee”</span>).
