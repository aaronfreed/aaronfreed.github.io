			<h1 class="centred petitecaps">Genevieve&rsquo;s Paladin Oath</h1>
			<p>A custom oath I&rsquo;ve written for a D&D campaign I&rsquo;m playing. Sub-bullets (in italics) are not actually part of her oath; they are my clarifications and elaborations on elements of her oath.</p>
		</header>
		<main>
			<ol>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability, minimize harm to sapient life as a whole.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>Thus, if someone is threatening to set off a doomsday device that threatens sapient life as a whole, she has a duty to end that person&rsquo;s life. This oath also obligates her to prevent acts of genocide.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where this does not conflict with my first oath, minimize harm to sentient life as a whole.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>This includes not just humans and elves and so on, but also animals. Which means she is vegetarian.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where this does not conflict with my first two oaths, minimize harm to life as a whole.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>So, plants and fungi and so on.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where this does not conflict with my first three oaths, minimize harm to sapient individuals.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>This does not prevent her from fighting or taking the lives of those who are threatening others&rsquo; wellbeing, but she cannot and will not attack anyone without provocation.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where this does not conflict with my first four oaths or Nature Herself, minimize harm to sentient individuals.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>If one animal is preying on another, she can&rsquo;t do anything about it. However, she is duty-bound to prevent acts like poaching; in fact, she has a specific loathing of poachers.</em></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where this does not conflict with my first five oaths or Nature Herself, minimize harm to individual non-sentients.</li>
				<li class="hyphenate">I will, to the best of my ability and where the following does not conflict with my first six oaths, preserve art, culture, science, philosophy, and knowledge &ndash; our sources of light, joy, knowledge, beauty, and meaning. I will be a beacon of light in the darkness, a source of shelter in a storm. My word is my bond, and I will neither break it nor lie unless I must do so to preserve innocent life. Where there is need, I will seek to fulfill it. Where there is despair, I will seek to bring hope. Where there is injustice, I will seek to correct it. I will be fair and impartial, and I will listen to others&rsquo; perspectives before I act or speak. I will treat others not as I wish to be treated, but as they wish to be treated. I will not nurse grudges, abet hatred, or tolerate intolerance. I will embody the behavior I wish others to emulate. I will be frank about my flaws and seek to correct them, but I will forgive imperfection in both myself and others, so long as they seek to improve, and I will find beauty in imperfection. I will swear no oaths that contradict the above; they will remain my highest duties.
					<ul>
						<li class="hyphenate"><em>This will be a &ldquo;living oath&rdquo;: she will only have sworn its first and final sentences at the start of the campaign. As it progresses and she gains abilities, she will swear additional sentences. Its contents will be widely known in the setting, to the extent that it will be widely understood that paladins cannot, e.g., take on positions that require them to intentionally deceive others for purposes short of, e.g., preventing a war or other loss of innocent life, even if they have not yet sworn that part of their oaths.</em></li>
