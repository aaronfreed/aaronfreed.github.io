				<p>Many times, you&rsquo;ll come across recordings that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)" target="_blank">digital clipping distortion</a> or missing upper frequencies due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression#Lossy_audio_compression" target="_blank">lossy audio compression</a> or low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)" target="_blank">sample rates</a>. While none of these processes are fully reversible, they are possible to mitigate to some extent using declipping (in the former case) and a process that I&rsquo;ve come to &ldquo;upmastering&rdquo; (credit to <strong>Solra Bizna</strong> for the name). I described these processes in a PDF I included with the <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 OST, found on my <a href="soundtracks.html#eternalx12"><em>Marathon</em> soundtracks page</a>. This is an updated version of those notes.</p>

				<p>Note that, while I wrote this guide with iZotope RX in mind (the gold standard of audio repair software, in my book), it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to adapt its principles in other audio processing software. The quality of your results may vary, depending on how good your chosen software is at declipping and pitch-shifting audio.</p>

			<h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 0px;" class="centred">Adapted from <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2&rsquo;s OST liner notes, with edits for clarity,<br />
			brevity, &amp; insights from five subsequent years of working with sound</h4>

			<h2 id="declipping" class="centred">Step One: Declipping</h2>

			<p>My first step for around 75% of [the <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 OST] was declipping. Many people seem to pay little attention to the levels when mixing and/or mastering songs; as a result, the peaks and troughs of waveforms get clipped off (it&rsquo;s essentially the result of a variable overflow), creating a form of distortion informally referred to as &lsquo;black noise&rsquo;. It results in a muffled sound and can cause listener fatigue. (If you want to find yourself annoyed at 90% of modern music, look up the loudness war.)</p>

			<p>Thus, I employed iZotope&rsquo;s declipper for any song that clipped. I must emphasize that the declipper <em>cannot</em> perfectly reconstruct the data lost from clipping, but it usually comes up with reasonable approximations that will suffice for most people&rsquo;s listening. The declipper scans the waveform and tells you where it clips. You can usually set the filter to start at 0.25 or 0.5 dB below that and get good results.</p>

			<p>(I&rsquo;d usually recommend running this process on an entire album at once to avoid messing up gapless transitions and preserve its songs&rsquo; relative volumes, which can have artistic reasoning behind them. However, here, I could reasonably infer that they didn&rsquo;t, so I did this process song-by-song. Additionally, on some albums, some songs may clip at different levels; for that matter, different segments of individual songs may also clip at different levels. <em>Listen</em>, and use your best judgement.)</p>

			<p>(Notably, iZotope themselves <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/order-of-audio-repair-operations.html" target="_blank">recommend declipping before performing any other audio repair</a>.)</p>

			<h2 id="phaserotation" class="centred">Step Two: Phase Rotation</h2>

			<p>Next, I ran most songs 90&deg; through a phase rotation filter; this mostly affects subsonic (&leq;20 Hz) frequencies, but also usually increases dynamic range. I have no hypothesis for why this reduces listener fatigue; it shouldn&rsquo;t be perceptibly different at all. However, this is the only palatable way I&rsquo;ve found to listen to various albums that are too distorted to salvage with declipping (i.e., <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref01" title="I wouldn&rsquo;t even think to mess with Merzbow&rsquo;s work when listening to it on speakers, but this is the only way I know of to listen to those albums on headphones without risking deafness. They are, to my knowledge, the two loudest albums ever pressed to CD.">Merzbow&rsquo;s <em>Venereology</em> and <em>Pulse Demon</em><a href="#ftnt01" class="normal">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>; the Psychic Paramount&rsquo;s <em>Gamelan into the Mink Supernatural</em>). Since it performed wonders for those recordings, it&rsquo;s now a standard part of my remastering process.</p>

			<blockquote><em>[<strong>Warning:</strong> You should generally only use phase rotation on a finished mix, unless there are phase issues with a recording you&rsquo;re mixing; phase rotation can be destructive. In the most extreme case, phase rotating a recording by 180&deg; and mix pasting it with its original produces silence!]</em></blockquote>

			<p class="sectionbreak noprint"><a href="#top">Back to top</a> &middot; <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking101.html">Mapmaking (basic)</a> &middot; <a href="mapmaking.html">Mapmaking (advanced)</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a> &middot; <a href="soundtracks.html"><em>Marathon</em> soundtracks</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a></p>

			<h2 id="upmastering" class="centred">Step Three: Upmastering</h2>

			<p>The above two steps, along with normalising to &minus;0.1 dB, should suffice for any recording for which you have a lossless source. Unfortunately, this was the case for none of the <em>Eternal</em> tracks; they were all MP3s. Craig Hardgrove and Nicholas Singer didn&rsquo;t have higher-quality versions of their recordings; Dr Hardgrove said he might someday be able to make lossless versions, but it didn&rsquo;t sound like it&rsquo;d be <span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref02" title="As it happened, it took more than five years. Craig released the GarageBand source tracks on 2024-01-15, which included lossless mixes of eleven tracks from Eternal 1.2&rsquo;s OST and higher-quality lossy mixes of six more. I released remasters of these, with the six lossy tracks newly upmastered, on 2024-01-23; see Marathon: Somewhere in the Heavens on my Marathon soundtracks page.">anytime soon.<a href="#ftnt02">&#8317;&sup2;&#8318;</a></span> Thus, I approximated the missing upper frequencies as well, using a process we might call &ldquo;upmastering&rdquo;. (I was unable to contact Thomas Livingston or Eike Steffen at all.)</p>

			<p>In each case, I copied my results to a new file. Then I ran the &lsquo;pitch &amp; time&rsquo; filter to raise the pitch by 12 half-steps, or an octave, using the highest possible quality algorithm, Radius. This is a time-consuming, processor-intensive task that may take several times a song or album&rsquo;s running time on many machines. Feel free to step away to get a drink or something while it runs.</p>

			<p>Once it finishes, roll off the lower frequencies of your pitch-raised copy with the Corrective EQ filter. You&rsquo;ll want to discard everything below about 14 kHz, depending upon the quality of MP3 compression. I used the analogue filter &lsquo;low shelf&rsquo; for most of the bands, but the exact slope and gain I used depended on the track. Lastly, mix paste the results with your original track. You may have to try several different EQ settings to find the best-sounding version; unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution, as simply eyeballing the results won&rsquo;t suffice. <em>Listen</em>, and use your best judgement. If satisfied, normalise to &minus;0.1 dB, export as FLAC, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

			<blockquote><em>[<strong>Note:</strong> Modern versions of iZotope call this filter simply &lsquo;EQ&rsquo;, and rather than using the low shelf, you can just use a high pass filter with it. I&rsquo;ve also taken to adding a much subtler low pass filter as well.]</em></blockquote>

			<p>This process may be able to salvage many modern recordings that you may otherwise find fatiguing. To be honest, I find myself putting about 90% of the music I download these days through at least some of these steps, but I admit to being obsessive about this sort of thing. Regardless, I hope some readers find it useful for some of the worst offenders.</p>

			<h2 id="harmonics" class="centred">A Note on Harmonics, or Why Upmastering (Sometimes) Works</h2>

			<p>Upmastering works much better for some instruments than for others. Essentially, if an instrument is primarily based on even harmonics (meaning that if you a play a 440 Hz note, it will have resonant frequencies at 880 Hz, 1,760 Hz, 3,520 Hz, 7,040 Hz, 14,080 Hz, etc.), it will work almost flawlessly; if it is primarily based on odd harmonics, it won&rsquo;t work nearly as well, though many listeners still probably won&rsquo;t be able to notice since the above process results in most frequencies below 16 kHz being rolled off.</p>

			<p>As it so happens, nearly every instrument prominent in rock music &ndash; drums, bass, guitar, organ, and piano &ndash; has fairly substantial even harmonics. This is less reliable for jazz and classical instruments &ndash; closed-end wind instruments tend to be based almost entirely on odd harmonics, so a clarinet will have almost no resonant frequencies an octave apart, while a trumpet will only have some. Synthesizers are a complete mixed bag; some synth voices have no even harmonics at all, while others have plenty. <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/harmonics-and-musical-instruments.1057484/">This Steve Hoffman Forums thread</a> may be enlightening on this count.</p>

			<h2 id="orderofoperations" class="centred">Order of Operations</h2>

			<p>So, in summation, your steps are as follows:</p>

			<ol style="padding-left: 15px;">
				<li>Declip.</li>
				<li>Phase rotate.</li>
				<li>Normalize to &minus;0.1 dB.</li>
				<li>Copy results of step 3 to new document.</li>
				<li>Pitch-shift copy up by 12 semitones.</li>
				<li>EQ copy with aggressive high pass and somewhat less aggressive low pass.</li>
				<li>Reduce volume of copy as needed.</li>
				<li>Mix paste copy with results of step 3.</li>
				<li>Preview audio, comparing results of step 8 to results of step 3.</li>
				<li>If it sounds off, roll back changes and tweak EQ and levels until mix-pasted results sound good.</li>
				<li>Normalize to &minus;0.1 dB again, just to be safe.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>A final warning: <strong>The spectrogram isn&rsquo;t an EQ tool.</strong> It&rsquo;s more important that your remasters <em>sound</em> good than that their spectrogram <em>looks</em> good. At most, the spectrogram can help you <em>guess</em> what levels and EQ to use for your first attempt, but you should rely on your ears for sounds, not your eyes.</p>
