		<h1 id="intro" class="centred">2024 Introduction</h1>

		<div class="fixheight">
			<p>This is my review/exegesis of the French avant-garde black metal band <span class="weight3 accent">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s output, primarily focusing on the era from 2004 to 2012 (I originally wrote this as a review of a self-titled seven-LP anthology of that material). This box set centres around three concept albums about God, the Devil, and humanity&rsquo;s relation to both: <em lang="la" class="weight3 accent">Si mon&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tum re&shy;qui&shy;res, cir&shy;cum&shy;spi&shy;ce</em> (a 2-LP set); <em lang="la" class="weight3 accent">Fas &ndash; i&shy;te, ma&shy;le&shy;dic&shy;ti, in ig&shy;nem ae&shy;ter&shy;num</em>; and <em lang="la" class="weight3 accent">Pa&shy;ra&shy;cle&shy;tus</em>. (It figures that one of my favourite bands would love Latin just as much as I do.) Also included are three LPs&rsquo; worth of additional material from the same era that the band seems to consider appendices to its trilogy.</p>
			
			<p>I posted a slightly earlier version of this to <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/music-review/Cassandra_Leo/deathspell-omega/deathspell-omega-1/177159069" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Rate Your Music</a> and much earlier (and far less complete) versions to <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Review.asp?id=1523818" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Prog Archives</a> and <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Deathspell_Omega/Picture_Disc_Box/341895/Cassandra_Leo/74359" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Metal Archives</a>; I reprinted it here on 2024-08-10 as part of an ongoing effort to collect my best long-form writing in one place. I&rsquo;ve made several edits to it, primarily to <!-- highlight the names of people, bands, and works that I write about. The first mention of any of these will be in <span class="weight3 accent">bold, blue text</span> (the text is slightly darker if you&rsquo;re using a dark theme and slightly brighter if you&rsquo;re not). Successive mentions use <span class="weight2 toc-counter">slightly less bold, still blue text</span> (which is slightly brighter in dark themes and slightly darker in light ones). Additionally, I&rsquo;ve--> divide<!--d--> the review into sections to make it easier to read and navigate. <!--Where possible, I&rsquo;ve also added release dates for works in ISO 8601 (i.e., yyyy-mm-dd), the objectively correct date format.--> I&rsquo;ve also cut out a few extraneous words here and there, but this remains a very long review, made longer by my addition of some information that has come to light since I wrote it.</p>

			<p>Since these are reviews of music in a niche genre that I wrote for music websites, I felt comfortable assuming my readers were familiar with some of the band&rsquo;s contemporaries and with music history in general. Since this review is already around 5,000 words long, I haven&rsquo;t expanded it to fill in potential gaps in readers&rsquo; knowledge, but I could be persuaded to footnote it if you ask nicely.</p>

			<p>Although it may not be especially obvious from my own musical output (I couldn&rsquo;t mimic their compositional style in a million years), <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> are one of my three favourite musical groups of all time (alongside <span class="weight3 accent">Genesis</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</span>), and <em lang="la" class="toc-counter weight2">Fas &ndash; ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum</em> is probably my favourite album of all time. They also rank alongside <span class="weight3 accent">Pink Floyd</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">Brian Eno</span> in the profundity of their impact on my thinking, and <em class="weight3 accent">The Furnaces of Palingenesia</em> (not included in this box set) ranks alongside <span class="weight3 accent">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent">Hostile Architecture</em> as the most effective musical catalogue I&rsquo;ve ever heard of the modern era&rsquo;s ills.</p>

			<p>I must warn, however, that their music most assuredly isn&rsquo;t for everyone; upon first listen, it&rsquo;ll seem extremely harsh and dissonant to those unaccustomed to black metal and/or avant-garde music. (When asked about their influences, they tellingly cited <span class="weight3 accent">John Coltrane</span> first [if the connection escapes you, go listen to <em class="weight3 accent">The Olatunji Con&shy;cert</em>]; their long list also included <span class="weight3 accent">Gy&shy;&ouml;r&shy;gy Li&shy;ge&shy;ti</span>, <span class="weight3 accent">Krzysz&shy;tof Pen&shy;der&shy;ec&shy;ki</span>, <span class="weight3 accent">Ivan Wysch&shy;ne&shy;grad&shy;sky</span>, <span class="weight3 accent">Gia&shy;cin&shy;to Scel&shy;si</span>, and <span class="weight3 accent">Di&shy;a&shy;man&shy;da Ga&shy;l&aacute;s</span>.) Subsequent listens can reveal complex, often gorgeous melodies beneath the apparent dissonance (the word <em class="weight2 toc-counter">polytonality</em> is rarely far from my mind when listening to <em lang="la" class="toc-counter weight2">Fas</em> or 2016-11-08&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent">The Synarchy of Molten Bones</em>), but many people won&rsquo;t feel inclined to listen that much. Which, to be clear, is fine. The band&rsquo;s metaphysical stances and their decision to collaborate with certain unsavoury characters, both of which I address below, can also be sticking points for some listeners. Which is also fine.</p>
			
			<p>Regardless, they&rsquo;re among the few modern musical acts to whom I&rsquo;d, without hesitation, ascribe the term <em>genius</em>, and even when I&rsquo;ve disagreed with them (which isn&rsquo;t especially often &ndash; the most obvious example that comes to mind concerns the Austrian-British philosopher <span class="accent weight3">Karl Popper</span>&rsquo;s concept of the <span class="toc-counter weight2">paradox of tolerance</span>), I&rsquo;ve found their stances to reflect defensible reasoning.</p>
			
			<p>As a final note before we begin in earnest, I&rsquo;ll note that I&rsquo;ve endeavoured to avoid personal religious beliefs to the extent that a review of an act such as Deathspell Omega can avoid them &ndash; I think matters of religion are interesting to think about, but I suspect I don&rsquo;t have the gene required to engage with them on a deeper emotional level. While I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s especially relevant, I suspect some readers might, so I&rsquo;ll clarify that my sole convictions (calling these <em>beliefs</em> might be understating their severity) of any sort concerning deities are that:</p>
				
				<ol class="lowergreek accent">
					<li><span class="light maincolor">Omnipotence is logically problematic.</span></li>
					<li><span class="light maincolor">If free will exists, omniscience is equally logically problematic (barring possibilities such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation" target="_blank">many-worlds interpretation</a> of quantum physics&hellip; perhaps).</span></li>
					<li><span class="light maincolor">If deities exist, mere humans cannot possibly hope to understand them. (In case anyone finds it ironic that I linked an article about quantum physics immediately <em>before</em> discussing what humans cannot possibly hope to understand, I must clarify that I did that entirely on purpose. Quantum physics actually <em>is</em> potentially comprehensible, but it does require clearing dualistic thoughts from one&rsquo;s mind: you&rsquo;ll never understand it if you can&rsquo;t understand how, e.g., a photon can exist as both a wave and a particle at once.)</span></li>
				</ol>
			<p>In short, I&rsquo;m agnostic: I neither believe nor disbelieve in the existence of deities themselves, and I hear the jury&rsquo;s still out on <a href="https://youtu.be/A_sHriUR1IY" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: line-through underline;">science</a> free will. But stance <span class="accent">&gamma;</span>, at least, seems not entirely dissimilar from Deathspell Omega&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="fixheight">
	<p>I&rsquo;ll preface this by advising readers to sit down: this review is some 4,000 words long. But then, a review of nearly five hours of fantastic music with dense, philosophical lyrics <em>has</em> to be long to do proper justice to its subject.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;m primarily reviewing a vinyl box set treatment of one of the twenty-first century&rsquo;s most essential black metal bands that collects all their finest work up to its release date (2012-07-09). Picture discs&rsquo; fidelity is frequently lambasted, but much of the material here (namely, the contents of the first four discs) seems to have been separately mastered for vinyl, and certainly sounds substantially better than the typically brickwalled CD versions. It was also extremely reasonably priced when it went on sale, retailing for US$111, a shockingly low price for a seven-LP set, though second-hand vinyl&rsquo;s price inflation means you&rsquo;ll no doubt have to pay quite a lot more now.</p>

	<p>Since <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> write lyrics first and regard words and music as equal in importance, I&rsquo;ll be addressing their lyrics and ideology before their music. But since it&rsquo;s 2024, I&rsquo;m starting with the matter of the band&rsquo;s (presumed) membership. I say &ldquo;presumed&rdquo; because <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s proud tradition of anonymity makes almost everything about their membership a matter of conjecture &ndash; thus the credits above.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="vocalists">Vocalists</h2>
<div class="fixheight">
	<p>In any case, if I were extremely generous, I&rsquo;d say their presumed lead vocalist throughout this collection, <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1027827]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/mikko-aspa" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Mikko Aspa</a>, is not a particularly pleasant person &ndash; if I were <em>extremely</em> generous. But he also doesn&rsquo;t write the music or lyrics. (Starting with <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Chaining the Katechon&rdquo;</span>, there&rsquo;s clearly a second vocalist on many of these tracks. The most common hypothesis for said vocalist is <a target="_blank" title="[Artist67230]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/s_v_e_s_t" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">S.V.E.S.T.</a>&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1412672]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/spica-1" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Spica</a>. I must stress that neither <span class="toc-counter weight2">Aspa</span> nor <span class="toc-counter weight2">Spica</span> have ever been confirmed by any official source as having contributed to any <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> track, but <span class="toc-counter weight2">Aspa</span>&rsquo;s involvement in particular is generally treated as an open secret, owing to his distinctive vocal style.)</p>

	<p>Presumably in reference to the controversy of <span class="toc-counter weight2">Aspa</span>&rsquo;s presumed involvement, the French core of the band have indicated in interviews that they find it productive to work with people with whom they disagree ideologically, since they believe ideological conflict is beneficial to art. I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with their stance on this, but I at least can respect it. (I&rsquo;ll link to the band&rsquo;s three most recent interviews in the &ldquo;lyrics &amp; ideology&rdquo; section.)</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="instrumentalists">The Core Power Trio: A Tradition of Anonymity</h2>
<div class="fixheight">

	<p>Due to Deathspell Omega&rsquo;s general secretiveness, no one knows for sure who&rsquo;s speaking in their interviews. The most common hypothesis is guitarist <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1412212]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/hasjarl" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Hasjarl</a>, real name <span class="accent weight3">Christian Bouché</span>, who has been listed on several streaming sites as their lyricist for several years, thus making him the only band member whose participation received any level of official confirmation from around 2002 to around 2019.</p>

	<p>The bassist is believed to go by the pseudonym of <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1412211]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/khaos-2" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Khaos</a> and is suggested on <span class="accent weight3">Metal Archives</span> to have been a past live member of Japanese band <a target="_blank" title="[Artist54648]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/barbatos" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Barbatos</a>, and the drummer is believed to be Hasjarl&rsquo;s brother, but only they know for sure. Until <span class="accent weight3">Apple Music</span> temporarily credited their songwriting to <span class="toc-counter weight2">&ldquo;Christian Bouché, Deathspell Omega, <span class="accent weight3">Stephane Bouché</span>, <span class="accent weight3">Sylvain Ranger</span>&rdquo;</span>, we didn&rsquo;t even have conjectured names for the drummer or bass player. I ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t even bother listing hearsay, but I&rsquo;m inclined to do so for the following reasons:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>While a streaming service is a strange source to leak the band members&rsquo; identities, it&rsquo;s also a relatively credible one &ndash; the residuals for plays of their music have to go to the songwriters, and someone has to have a record of that somewhere.</li>
		<li>If true, it also all but confirms the above rumour about two band members being relatives. It isn&rsquo;t entirely outside the realm of possibility that they&rsquo;re related in some way besides being siblings. (The likelihood that they&rsquo;re unrelated and coincidentally share a surname strikes me as considerably smaller.)</li>
		<li>As closely as they guarded their identities for some two decades, I also suspect they&rsquo;d be the last people to ask for this information to be erased now that it&rsquo;s out &ndash; given how much they know about technology, I suspect they could probably give an impromptu TED talk about the <span class="accent weight3">Streisand effect</span>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It is, in any case, reasonable to conclude that three people are primarily or entirely responsible for the instrumental performances; <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> have repeatedly cited a &ldquo;core power trio&rdquo; as being responsible for their songwriting, lyrics, and instrumentation. They&rsquo;ve also referred to a core group of musicians based in France and a &ldquo;second circle&rdquo; of musical collaborators &ndash; not to mention the video evidence: on 2024-01-09, they posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BT92vfE8qQ" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">rehearsal footage of the core trio practising <strong>&ldquo;The Fires of Frustration&rdquo;</strong></a> through their label&rsquo;s YouTube channel. Although it isn&rsquo;t possible to see their faces, it&rsquo;s very clear that a single guitarist, a single bassist, and a single drummer are producing all the sounds heard on the recording.</p>

	<p>A final name worth mentioning here is fellow Poitiers musician <span class="accent weight3">Franck Hueso</span> (of synth&shy;wave / elec&shy;tro house act <a target="_blank" title="[Artist888739]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/carpenter-brut" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Carpenter Brut</a>): <a target="_blank" title="[Artist606863]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ghost-4" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Ghost</a>&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1322647]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/tobias-forge" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Tobias Forge</a> cited him as <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s producer.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="primarysources">Primary Sources</h2>

<div class="fixheight">
	<p>In the following thousand words or so, I&rsquo;ll do my best to summarise the lyrical gist of the last eighteen years of recorded music and the contents of nearly sixteen thousand words in two interviews, but you&rsquo;ll get a much clearer and fuller picture by reading the band&rsquo;s own words &ndash; I&rsquo;m omitting a lot by necessity.</p>

	<p>For more on this, and a broader understanding of their ideology more generally, I strongly recommend reading at least the band&rsquo;s <a rel="nofollow noopener" class="underlinelink" target="_blank" href="http://www.bardomethodology.com/articles/2019/06/23/deathspell%2Domega%2Dinterview/">June 2019 interview with <span class="weight3">Bardo Methodology</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3">Niklas Göransson</span></a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener" class="underlinelink" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ctg3ZsuKmyeDvLE9d9X__ligsVmgNyneyzyd8ZryuQE/edit">its December 2019 follow-up</a>, and <a rel="nofollow noopener" class="underlinelink" target="_blank" href="http://www.cultneverdies.com/p/deathspell-omega.html">their 2020 interview with <span class="weight3">Cult Never Dies</span>&rsquo; <span class="weight3">Roy Kristensen</span></a> in their entirety, plus the lyrics to all their releases since at least <em class="toc-counter weight3">Si monumentum</em>, and the fable for <em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/deathspell-omega/the-long-defeat-2/" class="album weight3 underlinelink">The Long Defeat</a></em>. If you have the patience to read a review this long, you may as well read some even longer interviews with one (?) of the smartest people in metal revealing what makes him (?) tick in unprecedented levels of detail. Even where I don&rsquo;t agree with him (?) (and that&rsquo;s not all that frequently), his (?) reasoning is at least engaging and thought-provoking. (The question marks are necessary because of the band&rsquo;s anonymity.)</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="furnaces"><em>The Furnaces of Palingenesia</em>, Georges Bataille, &amp; the Marquis de Sade</h2>

<div class="fixheight">
	<p>Regardless, DsO have repeatedly said their largest literary influence by far is the French Marxist <span class="accent weight3">Georges Bataille</span>, an ardent critic of totalitarianism of all stripes who wrote several essays deconstructing the psychological mindset behind fascism. This was a major influence on the band&rsquo;s 2019-05-24 album <em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/deathspell-omega/the-furnaces-of-palingenesia-2/" class="album weight3 underlinelink">The Furnaces of Palingenesia</a></em>, which stood alone as the sharpest musical catalogue I&rsquo;d heard of the modern era&rsquo;s ills until <a target="_blank" title="[Artist1224451]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/ashenspire" class="artist weight3 underlinelink">Ashenspire</a> released <em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ashenspire/hostile-architecture-1/" class="album weight3 underlinelink">Hostile Architecture</a></em> on 2022-07-18 (which now ties it; <a href="hostilearchitecture.html" class="underlinelink weight3" target="_blank">see my review here</a>). DsO have cited as a central goal:</p>

		<blockquote class="toc-counter" style="margin: 8px 30px;">&ldquo;to shatter a myth that&rsquo;s so central to stability both on an individual and civilisational level: the impervious necessity to believe that what we do is just, that we are just, that good and evil in intent and deed are as distinct as night and day. That what we do is condoned either by God or whatever man-made order that&rsquo;s taken precedence &ndash; whose exceptionalism is of course indisputable and acts like a secular religion. Those who missed the religious nature of the ideology of progress, nationalism, Marxism, basically any discourse based on a human collective from an essentialist point of view, up to <span class="accent weight3">Milton Fried&shy;man</span>&rsquo;s approach to capitalism and the potential of a good narrative to befuddle the masses, <span class="accent weight3">Pied Piper of Hamelin</span>-style &ndash; haven&rsquo;t been paying much attention to their surroundings. In short, one of the questions emerging at the end of the process reads as follows: how much have YOU already surrendered to the Devil? How many of the depicted mechanisms have YOU unconsciously made your own, thus how infected and corrupt are YOU? People often greatly overestimate their innocence &ndash; the louder the virtue signalling, the higher the odds &ndash; but it takes a frank and courageous character to admit to that.&rdquo;</blockquote>

	<p>The antecedent here is ambiguous: they might merely mean <em>Furnaces</em>, but I take them to mean the totality of their work; and if we do so, this passage reframes this box set&rsquo;s contents in quite a different light and makes DsO&rsquo;s shift in subject matter with <em>Furnaces</em> feel far less sudden. They&rsquo;ve called their work since <em class="toc-counter weight2">Si monumentum</em>:</p>

		<blockquote class="toc-counter" style="margin: 8px 30px;">&ldquo;our <em class="accent weight3">Summa Diabolica</em>, based on the idea behind <span class="accent weight3">Bataille</span>&rsquo;s <em class="accent weight3">Somme athéologique</em>, which itself was an answer to <span class="accent weight3">Thomas Aquinas</span>&rsquo; <em class="accent weight3">Summa Theologica</em>.&rdquo;</blockquote>

	<p>If the last of these effectively argued for man&rsquo;s godliness, then <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> are making the exact opposite argument: humanity is <em>not</em> godly or even benevolent.</p>

	<p>In short, their argument within the contents of this box set has been interpreted as an <em>endorsement</em> of malevolence, but I think that&rsquo;s a severe misreading. I read their intention not as <em>prescription</em> but as <em>diagnosis</em>. They&rsquo;re not saying, &ldquo;This is what <em>should be</em>,&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;This is what <em>is</em>.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Their second-largest literary influence, <span class="accent weight3">Marquis de Sade</span>, is another tell. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Sade</span> remains a controversial, sometimes problematic writer whose work has been subject to numerous widely varying interpretations, but few literary critics believe he&rsquo;s endorsing his characters&rsquo; depravity. His political writings &ndash; the vast majority of which aren&rsquo;t easily available in English &ndash; make his better-known fiction come across very differently and the term <em>sadism</em> as nothing less than defamatory. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Sade</span> stood on the far-left of the <span class="accent weight3">French Revolution</span> and supported a property-free utopia, making him a sort of proto-anarcho-communist. In this context, his writings thus read not as <em>endorsing</em> his characters&rsquo; depravity, but as <em>condemning</em> a system that allows the rich and powerful to get away with all kinds of untold abuses, up to and including rape, torture, and murder. (That said, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Sade</span> was himself accused of numerous abuses. It remains unclear how many he truly committed, if any.)</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="longdefeat"><em>The Long Defeat</em>&rsquo;s Fable &amp; the Process of Elimination</h2>

<div class="fixheight">
	<p>Their 2022-03-23 album <em class="accent weight3">The Long Defeat</em>&rsquo;s fable may provide further context here. The Devil, in one of his more sincere moments (and paraphrasing arguments the band have made throughout their interviews), says:</p>

	<blockquote class="toc-counter" style="margin: 8px 30px;">&ldquo;You revel in inequity. Inequity is your womb! How dare you even speak? Your hand has been too busy casting stones when, all the while, it should&rsquo;ve covered your shameful face. Yes, I saw you! What you call civilisation is merely a fleeting attempt at taming the primordial beast. As you cannot fend off that ageless urge, how sly you are to channel it instead!&rdquo; He pauses. &ldquo;And even so, your entire species is a miser when it comes to mercy. It extends no further than what you have within your immediate sight. You are the direct descendant of perpetual discord. When your kind tries to impose sense upon the absurd, it is carried out through hierarchy. And since your hierarchies are ironclad, it must be enforced with arms. Tribe, class, caste, creed… words worth their weight in gold to whomever acquires a taste for blood and tears. Golden keys to swing wide open the very gates of Hell.&rdquo;</blockquote>

	<p>Between <em class="toc-counter weight2">The Long Defeat</em>, <em class="toc-counter weight2">The Furnaces of Palingenesia</em>, and their most recent published interviews, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> have rejected violent revolution, capitalism, communism, the state, and hierarchy itself. The only political philosophy that does not endorse at least one of these things is nonviolent anarchism, and in condemning the inequities in human society, the hierarchies that cause them, and our species&rsquo; history of enforcing the latter through violence, the Devil is making a textbook anarchist argument &ndash; and, since it mirrors several statements in <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s interviews, it&rsquo;s one their core members clearly agree with.</p>

	<p><span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s core argument in this collection, I would posit, is thus along the lines: We&rsquo;ve historically treated (and still treat) the natural environment (more on this when I discuss <em class="toc-counter weight2">Drought</em>) and each other like dirt, yet we persist in seeing ourselves as the heroes of our own stories and our species as benevolent. We need to stop both of these; these illusions actually make us <em>worse people</em>. To make positive changes, we must first recognise and accept the need to do so &ndash; which in turn means admitting to our own faults. Of course, <span class="toc-counter weight2">Deathspell Omega</span> also express deep scepticism that any such changes are forthcoming, a scepticism I must admit I share.</p>
</div>

<!--<p class="fixheight">Two final notes before I address their music:</p>

<ol class="fixheight">
	<li>In <em class="toc-counter weight2">The Long Defeat</em>&rsquo;s fable, the Devil takes the form of an enormous poodle. This may initially seem an odd depiction, but one of the few biographical details known about <span class="toc-counter weight2">Christian Bouch&eacute;</span> is that he was born in Germany. The poodle evolved in Germany, but, like Bouch&eacute;, is more associated with France. This is yet another reason I&rsquo;m all but certain he&rsquo;s speaking for the band here.</li>
	<li>Although the Devil is almost uniformly a figure of evil in modern readings of Christianity, that&rsquo;s a relatively modern interpretation; his original roles in scripture were to test humans&rsquo; loyalty and punish wrongdoing &ndash; not necessarily what most people would consider the province of evil. (The similarity between <em>evil</em> and <em>devil</em> is evidently coincidental; <em>devil</em> derives its etymology from the Ancient Greek <em class="weight3 accent">διάβολος</em>, <em class="weight2 toc-counter">di&aacute;bolos</em>, <em>false accuser</em>, while <em>evil</em> derives from the Old High German <em class="accent weight3">ubil</em>. The spellings of <em>devil</em> and <em>evil</em> may have later been retrofitted to resemble one another, but <em>devil</em> and <em>ballet</em> are more etymologically related than <em>devil</em> and <em>evil</em> &ndash; make of that what you will. <em>Satan</em>, meanwhile, derives from the Hebrew <em>שָׂטָן</em>, <em>śāṭān</em>, meaning <em>accuser</em> or <em>adversary</em>; his earliest function was to test humans&rsquo; loyalty, and most Jews don&rsquo;t believe in an omnimalevolent supernatural figure. The name <em>Lucifer</em> is literally Latin for <em>light-bringing</em> &ndash; also not the sort of epithet one would expect to be attached to evil.)</li>

<h3 class="centred" id="smrc" lang="la">2004-01-31: <em>Si monumentum requires, circumspice</em></h3>

<p class="fixheight">Having addressed the band&rsquo;s lyrics at some length, I shall now turn to the music in this collection. Their second era began with 2004-01-31&rsquo;s double LP set <em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/deathspell-omega/si-monumentum-requires-circumspice-2/" class="album underlinelink">Si monumentum requires, circumspice</a></em> (Latin for <em>If You&rsquo;ll Seek a Monument, Look Around</em> &ndash; for more on this title&rsquo;s translation and meaning, see the end of this review), which serves as a mission statement for everything the band has done since. It unveiled the band&rsquo;s trademark blend of dissonance, unusual time signatures (though these had been present on previous works as well), complex arrangements, philosophical lyrics on humanity&rsquo;s corrupt nature, and experimentalism. Much of the album is given over to furious blasting, but the band proves to do this in a much more musically sophisticated fashion than most of its peers. The production is also a major step up from that of the band&rsquo;s previous work; it still sounds filthy and savage, but the album is recorded and mixed clearly enough that every musical detail is clearly audible. This proves all to the better on the departures from the band&rsquo;s black metal sound, such as the three &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; and the chant section in the album&rsquo;s centrepiece &ldquo;Carnal Malefactor&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>Even after the butchery I&rsquo;m sure Google Translate has done to it, that quote strikes me as beautiful.</p>

	<p>The chant is deservedly one of the album&rsquo;s most iconic moments &ndash; one of black metal&rsquo;s most iconic moments, in fact; in the context of the album, it&rsquo;s absolutely heartbreaking (though some listeners also reportedly find it frightening, especially its ending). It&rsquo;s one of many reasons <em>SMRC</em> is a landmark album in the field of black metal whose stature has only grown with time. &ldquo;Carnal Malefactor&rdquo; in particular remains a career highlight.</p>

<p class="fixheight">That said, DsO arguably surpassed <em>SMRC</em> as a whole almost immediately: they quickly followed it up in 2005 with an additional two LPs&rsquo; worth of material between the EP <em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/deathspell-omega/kenose-4/" class="album underlinelink">Kénôse</a></em> (French for <em>kenosis</em>, derived from the Greek <em>κένωσις</em>, a doctrine in Christian theology referring to Jesus&rsquo; &ldquo;emptying himself&rdquo;) and two side-length pieces that were released on split albums the same year. <em>Kénôse</em>, released 2005-05-08, is even more dissonant and complex than <em>SMRC</em>, and shows the band&rsquo;s growing musical maturity. It&rsquo;s also philosophically more sophisticated than the band&rsquo;s previous works, showcasing a thorough examination of Christian redemption.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="diabolusabsconditus">2005-07-11: &ldquo;Diabolus absconditus&rdquo;</h3>

<p class="fixheight">The next LP in the collection, also released as <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/deathspell-omega/diabolus-absconditus-mass-grave-aesthetics/" class="album underlinelink">a standalone LP</a>, collects two side-length pieces from the same era. The first, the twenty-two-minute &ldquo;<a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/deathspell-omega/diabolus-absconditus/" class="album underlinelink">Diabolus absconditus</a>&rdquo; (Latin: &ldquo;Hidden Devil&rdquo;; first released on 2005-07-11&rsquo;s six-way split <em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/various-artists/crushing-the-holy-trinity-1/" class="album underlinelink">Crushing the Holy Trinity</a></em>) lyrically examines existentialism and the concept of <em><a rel="nofollow noopener" class="underlinelink" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hidden_God">Deus absconditus</a></em> (Latin: <em>Hidden God</em>, the idea that God is unknowable or has abandoned the world) while musically it alternates between blasting dissonance and, oddly, a lengthy acoustic guitar segment accompanied by whispered vocals. The band gives &ldquo;credit for tremendous revelation [&hellip;] in all humility&rdquo; to the French surrealist <span class="accent weight3">Georges Bataille</span>, whom they&rsquo;ve been citing as their largest literary influence for over two decades; many of its lyrics are verbatim quotes from his works. It effectively see-saws between existentialism and pornography that is played more for horror than for titillation, which is roughly par for the course where <span class="toc-counter weight1">Bataille</span> is concerned.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="fasitemaledictiinignemaeternum" lang="la">2007-07-16: <em>Fas &ndash; ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum</em></h3>

<div class="fixheight">
	<p><em><a target="_blank" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/deathspell-omega/fas-–-ite-maledicti-in-ignem-aeternum-3/" class="album underlinelink" lang="la">Fas &ndash; ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum</a></em> (Latin for <em>Divine Law &ndash; Depart, Ye Cursed, into Everlasting Fire</em>) dials up the band&rsquo;s dissonance and complexity even further, though many reviews exaggerate the former: this album still has plenty of melodic leads (especially on side two), but they&rsquo;re buried under so much chaos that it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to tell. Thanks especially to its utterly frantic drumming (one of the best drum performances I&rsquo;ve heard this side of <a target="_blank" title="[Artist138376]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/neil-peart" class="artist underlinelink">Neil Peart</a> or <a target="_blank" title="[Artist12415]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/christian-vander" class="artist underlinelink">Christian Vander</a>, by the way), <em>Fas</em> <span class="weight2">sounds</span> more dissonant than it actually <span class="weight2">is</span>.</p>

	<p>In this album&rsquo;s four proper songs (averaging about ten minutes in length), Deathspell Omega pack in as many complex riffs as possible and mix them with head-spinning philosophical lyrics that examine their exceedingly pessimistic view of the cosmos wherein both God and Satan are essentially incomprehensible to humans, who are doomed to suffering. (Incidentally, many of the lyrics are taken directly from works by Georges Bataille, whom Deathspell Omega have been citing as their largest literary influence for over two decades.)</p>

	<p>While most of <em>Fas</em> is given over to frenetic blasting, it&rsquo;s also underpinned with creepy pianos and an orchestra, and several passages are nearly silent, which only makes the returns to blasting all the more terrifying. (<a rel="nofollow noopener" class="underlinelink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5V6UdnBFw">This remaster</a> boosts the quietest passages&rsquo; levels enough to be clearly audible.) It climaxes with an utterly gorgeous guitar solo at the end of &ldquo;A Chore for the Lost&rdquo;, which proves to be perhaps its biggest concession to melody.</p>

	<p><em>Fas</em> is a harrowing listen but remains a landmark of the genre all the same. It&rsquo;s essentially black metal&rsquo;s answer to <a target="_blank" title="[Artist5023]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/gorguts" class="artist underlinelink">Gorguts</a> and is, in fact, my favourite metal album of all time.</p>

<h3 class="centred" id="drought">2012-06-22: <em>Drought</em></h3>

<p class="fixheight">The band&rsquo;s most recent EP (by recording date, at least), <em><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/deathspell-omega/drought-1/" class="album underlinelink">Drought</a></em>, closes out the set. Like <em>Paracletus</em>, this one consists mostly of continuous music (there are brief gaps between a few sets of tracks here) and musically, this may be the lightest material on this set. Their music barely has anything left in common with traditional black metal by this point, but that&rsquo;s hardly worth complaining about when what&rsquo;s here is so good. The band fills every proper song with truly mind-boggling riffs, and the album&rsquo;s intro and outro are unique in their catalogue, with the former sounding like a mix between <a target="_blank" title="[Artist31]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin" class="artist underlinelink">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a target="_blank" title="[Artist5539]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/earth" class="artist underlinelink">Earth</a> and the latter including a particularly nice groove on the bass guitar. As the band themselves have commented, the EP&rsquo;s lyrical concept is an allegory for humanity&rsquo;s self-destructive treatment of its natural environment, a topic they&rsquo;ve addressed perhaps even more overtly on their three albums (as of this writing) since its release.</p>

<h2 class="centred" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p class="fixheight">I can&rsquo;t recommend this box set highly enough to anyone attuned to its vision. The music is flawless, and my only complaints with its presentation are that it wasn&rsquo;t pressed on black or clear vinyl, and that the last three discs aren&rsquo;t remastered for vinyl. Still, those are minor complaints, especially since its price tag when it was released was startlingly low given how much music it contains (US$111 + shipping for nearly five hours of music on vinyl is a hard price to beat &ndash; of course, given the inflation of second-hand vinyl prices, good luck getting it that cheaply now). This band&rsquo;s work has been a landmark in the field of black metal, and this box set collects the best of it up to the time of its release. Unconditionally recommended for anyone remotely into heavy, experimental music.</p>

In other words, if you seek a mon&shy;u&shy;ment <em>to Wren</em>, his fin&shy;est ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;tu&shy;ral work is all ar&shy;ound you, so you need but look ar&shy;ound. We can in&shy;fer <em>his</em> from the con&shy;text of this sen&shy;tence being in&shy;scribed on Wren&rsquo;s tomb: to whom else would it be a mon&shy;u&shy;ment? In&shy;deed, if you look up the in&shy;scrip&shy;tion on Wren&rsquo;s tomb, some sour&shy;ces trans&shy;late it with a par&shy;en&shy;the&shy;ti&shy;cal &ldquo;his&rdquo;. I ob&shy;ject to this, as it&rsquo;s mis&shy;lead&shy;ing as a <em>ge&shy;ne&shy;ral trans&shy;la&shy;tion</em>; how&shy;ev&shy;er, it&rsquo;s ad&shy;mit&shy;ted&shy;ly im&shy;plied in the con&shy;text of <em>this spe&shy;ci&shy;fic in&shy;scrip&shy;tion</em>.</p>

(Pre&shy;sent tense is most com&shy;mon in such con&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;als, but fu&shy;ture tense would still gen&shy;er&shy;al&shy;ly be con&shy;si&shy;dered gram&shy;ma&shy;tic&shy;al&shy;ly ac&shy;cep&shy;ta&shy;ble in La&shy;tin.) The band has cla&shy;ri&shy;fied that the mon&shy;u&shy;ment to which they re&shy;fer is in fact the cur&shy;rent state of the world. To <em>what</em> is it a mon&shy;u&shy;ment, though?

<p class="fixheight"><em lang="la">Si mon&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tum re&shy;qui&shy;res, cir&shy;cum&shy;spi&shy;ce</em>&rsquo;s final track, &ldquo;Malign Paradigm&rdquo; (an instrumental cover of Swedish black metal band <a target="_blank" title="[Artist70292]" href="https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/malign" class="artist underlinelink">Malign</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ashes and Bloodstench&rdquo;, incidentally) is associated with the phrase &ldquo;<span lang="la" class="accent">Dei nostri templum terrarum orbus est</span>,&rdquo; often seen translated as &ldquo;The house and church of our Lord is childless.&rdquo; This is also wrong; none of these words mean <em>house</em>. Possible translations include:

	<ol>
		<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;The temple of our Lord&rsquo;s lands is (bereaved, childless, orphaned, widowed, destitute),&rdquo;</span> correctly written <span lang="la" class="accent">&ldquo;Dei nostri templum terrarum orbum est&rdquo;</span> &ndash; <em lang="la">orbus</em> (which has several possible meanings) should be neuter to match <em lang="la">templum</em>.</li>

		<li>My crackpot theory, however, is that they mean <em>both</em>; thus, both seeming mistakes are intentional sources of ambiguity. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine the core band members agreeing with either statement: antinatalism seems right in line with their philosophy, given the pessimism they&rsquo;ve expressed about humanity&rsquo;s future; and they&rsquo;ve also made it plain that they think nature is the closest thing on this planet left to a divine experience. Their few expressions of genuine enthusiasm or optimism in their interviews relate mostly to:

				<li>artistic endeavours (especially, but not exclusively, music), and</li>
				<li>mountaineering.</li>

<h2 id="phrases" class="centred">Other Latin Phrases</h2>

<ul class="fixheight">
	<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;Sōla fidē&rdquo;</span> is sometimes translated as &ldquo;only faith&rdquo;, but it uses the ablative case (which has no direct equivalent in English), so a more accurate translation is <span class="accent">&ldquo;by faith alone&rdquo;</span> or <span class="accent">&ldquo;with faith alone&rdquo;</span>. Deathspell Omega cite James 2:20 (from the King James Version, of course) to rebut the idea that faith alone can earn salvation: &ldquo;Wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?&rdquo;</li>
	<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;Odium nostrum&rdquo;</span> can mean <span class="accent">&ldquo;our hatred&rdquo;</span>, <span class="accent">&ldquo;our being hated&rdquo;</span>, or <span class="accent">&ldquo;the object of our hatred&rdquo;</span>, since <em>odium</em> means <em>hatred</em> (the abstract concept), <em>the condition of being hated</em>, and (metonymically) <em>an object of hatred</em>. It can also mean, in weaker senses, <em>boredom</em>, <em>weariness</em>, or <em>impatience</em>.</li>
	<li>The band helpfully translates <span class="accent">&ldquo;Jūbilāte Deō&rdquo;</span> in the subtitle of the song: &ldquo;O Be Joyful in the Lord&rdquo;. This is an entirely defensible (albeit archaic &ndash; thus, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the album&rsquo;s lyrics) translation, though we should note that the command is in the plural form. <em>Iūbilō</em> translates as <em>I sing or shout joyfully</em> or <em>I cheer</em>; <em>Deō</em> is the dative/ablative singular of <em>Deus</em>, meaning <em>God</em>. (The dative case is often, though not always, comparable to an indirect object in English.) Thus, it means roughly <em class="accent">rejoice to God</em>.</li>
	<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;Diabolus absconditus&rdquo;</span>, meaning <span class="accent">&ldquo;hidden devil&rdquo;</span>, is a play on the concept of <em class="accent">Deus absconditus</em>, or <em class="accent">hidden God</em>, which posits that God is now unknowable owing to humanity&rsquo;s sinful nature causing him to abandon the world. Deathspell Omega later used this as a major concept of <em>Drought</em>.</li>
	<li><em class="accent">Fās &ndash; īte, maledictī, in īgnem aeternum</em> means <em class="accent">Divine Law &ndash; Depart, Ye Cursed, into Everlasting Fire</em>. All of this except <em>Fās</em> comes from the Vulgate translation of Matthew 25:41 (part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_and_the_Goats" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">the Sheep and the Goats</a>); at the risk of stating the obvious, I&rsquo;ve used the King James Version&rsquo;s English translation (nothing else would aesthetically match Deathspell Omega&rsquo;s language so perfectly). Note that <em>īte</em> is a clipping of <em>discēdite</em> (which the KJV translates as &ldquo;depart from me&rdquo;) and is again plural.</li>
	<li><em class="accent">Paracl&emacr;tus</em> is a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek <em class="accent">παράκλητος</em> (romanized: <em class="accent">paráklētos</em>), meaning <em class="accent">advocate</em>, <em class="accent">comforter</em>, <em class="accent">protector</em>, <em class="accent">defender</em>, or <em class="accent">one called to help</em>. The English form of the word is <em class="accent">paraclete</em>. It is commonly used as a reference to the Holy Ghost.</li>

	<li><em class="accent">Kénôse</em> is French for <em class="accent">kenosis</em> (Greek: <em class="accent">κένωσις</em>; romanized: <em class="accent">kénosis</em>), meaning &ldquo;emptying&rdquo;. It refers to a controversial theological preposition about Jesus &ldquo;emptying himself&rdquo;. The less controversial meaning is that he simply emptied his desires; the more controversial proposition is that he actually became human in order to experience life as a mortal. Deathspell Omega explicitly address this theological controversy on the EP.</li>
	<li>An <span class="accent">epiclesis</span> (Greek: <em class="accent">ἑπίκλησης</em>, romanized: <em class="accent">epíklēsis</em>) is an invocation, especially a prayer invoking the Holy Spirit in the context of the Eucharist so as to transsubstantiate bread and wine.</li>
	<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;Apokatastasis pantôn&rdquo;</span> (Greek: <span class="accent">&ldquo;Ἀποκατάστᾰσις πάντων&rdquo;</span>; English: <em class="accent">apocatastasis of all things</em>) means <span class="accent">&ldquo;restoration of all things&rdquo;</span>, which can have two specific meanings:
		<ol class="loweralpha">
			<li>Restoration of all things to a condition of perfection. In Christianity, this means a form of universalism that teaches the ultimate salvation of everyone, including the damned and the Devil. Acts 3:21 uses this exact phrase, though it is not usually understood as teaching universal salvation. However, some Eastern Orthodox fathers, such as Gregory of Nyssa, taught apocatastasis and were never condemned. Nowadays, this is the more common usage of the term.</li>
			<li>An apocalypse that leads to the remaking of the world rather than a Final Judgement.</li>
		</ol>
	Ironically, the Synod of Constantinople condemned both these meanings in 543 CE.</li>
	<li>The phrase <em class="accent">κλέος ἄφθιτον</em>, found in &ldquo;Standing on the Work of Slaves&rdquo;, means, as the band suggests in the song, <em class="accent">immortal glory</em>. (It&rsquo;s usually romanized as <em>kléos áphthiton</em>, but <em class="accent">kléos áfthiton</em> is both less ugly and far less confusing. [Don&rsquo;t even get me started on <em>diphthong</em>, <em>ophthalmology</em>, <em>Nephthys</em>, etc., constantly being mispronounced and misspelled &ndash; if you pronounce any of those words with a <em>p</em>, you&rsquo;re pronouncing it wrong. The <em>ph</em> is pronounced <em>f</em>. Romanizing <em>φθ</em> as <em>phth</em> is Objectively Bad Orthography &ndash; far too often, people&rsquo;s brains simply refuse to process the first <em>h</em> because it looks like a mistake.])</li>
	<li><span class="accent">&ldquo;Enantiodromia&rdquo;</span> is derived from the Greek <em class="accent" lang="grc">ἐναντιοδρομίας</em>, <em>enantiodromias</em>, a compound word meaning <em class="accent">opposite running course</em> that was apparently coined by Johannes Stobaeus in <em>Eclogarum physicarum et ethicarum</em> (Late Latin meaning roughly <em>Of Excerpts of Natural and Moral Philosophy</em>) to refer to a central concept of Heraclitus&rsquo; philosophy regarding the tendency of things to turn into their opposites, especially in the absence of balance. More recently, Friedrich Nietzsche and Carl Jung re-popularized the concept.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fixheight">I should note: while I know enough Latin to be dangerous, I&rsquo;m by no means fluent (to the extent that one can be fluent in a language with no native speakers). I could perhaps start a fight, but certainly not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est" class="underlinelink" target="_blank">an entire war with Carthage</a>. By contrast, I barely even know enough Greek to be dangerous to myself.</p>
