		<p class="fixheight">This is my review of the Scottish metal band <span class="weight3 accent">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s album <a href="https://ashenspire.bandcamp.com/album/hostile-architecture" target="_blank" class="weight3 accent italic">Hostile Architecture</a>, released 2022-07-18. I&rsquo;ve posted it in various forms to <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/Review.asp?id=2778507" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Prog Archives</a>, <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Ashenspire/Hostile_Architecture/1041567/Cassandra_Leo/74359" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Metal Archives</a>, and <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/music-review/Cassandra_Leo/ashenspire/hostile-architecture/176829746" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">Rate Your Music</a>; I reprinted it here on 2024-08-09 as part of an ongoing effort to collect my best long-form writing in one place.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve made a few edits here, most notably to highlight the names of people, bands, and works that I write about. The first mention of any of these will be in <span class="weight3 accent">bold, blue text</span> (the text is slightly darker if you&rsquo;re using a dark theme and slightly brighter if you&rsquo;re not). Successive mentions use <span class="weight2 toc-counter">slightly less bold, still blue text</span> (which is slightly brighter in dark themes and slightly darker in light ones). Where possible, I&rsquo;ve also added release dates for works in ISO 8601 (i.e., yyyy-mm-dd), the objectively correct date format. I&rsquo;ve also cut out a few extraneous words here and there, but this remains a very long review.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I was reviewing an album in a niche genre on music websites, so I could assume my readers were familiar with some of the band&rsquo;s contemporaries and with music history in general. As this review is already over 2,500 words long, I&rsquo;ve left that intact, but I could be persuaded to footnote it if you ask nicely.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">This remains my favourite album released this decade, and I stand by every word of this review. (To be fair, I&rsquo;ve spent very little time listening to others&rsquo; music since getting my hands on a modern DAW in 2022-12 &ndash; perfecting my own music has simply been too time-consuming.) The band also <a href="ashenspire_post.png" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">directly linked to it</a> on Facebook and Twitter, which I found quite pleasing. You can buy it <a href="https://ashenspire.bandcamp.com/album/hostile-architecture" target="_blank" class="underlinelink">on Bandcamp</a>.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><span class="weight3 accent">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent">Speak Not of the Laudanum Quandary</em> (2017-01-20) slipped under my radar for two years after its release, but I was suitably impressed when I finally heard it and wrote, &ldquo;I foresee great things from these guys in the future.&rdquo; So naturally, when the band announced <em class="weight3 accent">Hostile Architecture</em> (2022-07-18), I already had high expectations; they were piqued further by the intriguing album description, and still further by its uniformly glowing reviews in the music press.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Sometimes, when I go into an album with such high expectations, I find myself disappointed. I&rsquo;m pleased to report that the opposite was the case here. As terrible as 2022 has been on most fronts, it&rsquo;s been a fantastic year for music, and I was having a hard time narrowing down my favourite album of the year so far. <span class="toc-counter weight2">Ashenspire</span> helpfully solved that dilemma for me by blowing all other contenders out of the water.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><em class="weight3 accent">Speak Not of the Laudanum Quandary</em> was a fantastic debut, but while the comparisons to <span class="weight3 accent">A Forest of Stars</span> might&rsquo;ve been rather glib, it&rsquo;s difficult to deny that Ashenspire wore their influences on their sleeves on their debut. (An overlooked influence is <span class="weight3 accent">Devil Doll</span>, confirmed by both <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span> in at least one interview and <span class="weight2 toc-counter">A Forest of Stars</span> in at least three. Without the <span class="weight3 accent">Mr Doctor</span>-like <em>Sprechgesang</em> of both <span class="weight3 accent">Alasdair Dunn</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">Dan Eyre</span>&rsquo;s vocals, I think perhaps the latter two would&rsquo;ve felt less similar, though <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em>&rsquo;s Victorian theme would&rsquo;ve still invited the comparisons regardless.) Where the record lacked in originality, it made up for it with execution &ndash; its performances, songwriting, and arrangements were fantastic all around.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><em class="weight3 accent">Hostile Architecture</em> keeps up the execution, perhaps even one-upping its predecessor on that front, but the band here shifts focus from the legacy of history to the state of the modern world, and the result is all the stronger for it. It&rsquo;s the <em class="weight3 accent">Teethed Glory and Injury</em> to the debut&rsquo;s <em class="weight3 accent">White Tomb</em>, if I may compare their progression to <span class="weight3 accent">Altar of Plagues</span>&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t make that comparison frivolously, as <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Teethed Glory</em> was one of my favourite albums of the 2010s, if not my absolute favourite, and I hadn&rsquo;t heard another record that felt like a spiritual successor to it both in terms of tone and in terms of quality. Until this one.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Please forgive a brief digression on what makes a work avant-garde. The quick answer is, <strong>&strns;&bsol;(&deg;_o)/&strns;</strong>. But obviously, it contains an element of pushing boundaries. This may take several forms. Take two seminal &rsquo;60s avant-garde acts, <span class="weight3 accent">the Velvet Underground</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">the Mothers of Invention</span>:</p>

		<ul class="fixheight">
			<li><span class="weight2 toc-counter">The Velvets</span> were avant-garde on multiple fronts: they were musically inventive, using musical forms and instruments that had never been attempted in what might be charitably described as popular music; and lyrically inventive, frankly discussing topics like drug addiction, prostitution, sadomasochism, homosexuality, transvestitism, gender dysphoria, and abuse that had previously been taboo in what might be charitably described as popular music. And on top of that, their music still slaps.</li>

			<li><span class="weight2 toc-counter">The Mothers</span> were likewise, if you&rsquo;ll pardon the pun, inventive, blending elements from pop, rock, classical, jazz, blues, and basically any other genre they could think of, effectively inventing progressive rock in the process. <em class="weight3 accent">Absolutely Free</em> (1967-05-26), arguably the first true progressive rock album, came out the same day as <em class="weight3 accent">Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> (also 1967-05-26), thus preceding <em class="weight3 accent">In the Court of the Crimson King</em> (1969-10-10) by over two years and <em class="weight3 accent">Days of Future Passed</em> (1967-11-10) by six months. And their music was likewise fantastic.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="fixheight">Yet, if someone blends those elements today in a similar way, they aren&rsquo;t avant-garde; they&rsquo;re imitators. They might be <em>very good</em> imitators, but they aren&rsquo;t avant-garde. It&rsquo;s intrinsic to the definition of <em class="weight3 accent">avant-garde</em>: it&rsquo;s literally French for <em class="weight3 accent">before the guard</em>, or (less literally) <em class="weight3 accent">vanguard</em>. Thus, a crucial element of the avant-garde is originality. It might be <em>the</em> crucial element.</p>

		<p class="fixheight"><em class="weight2 toc-counter">Speak Not of the Laudanum Quandary</em> wasn&rsquo;t wholly unoriginal; you could hear the seeds of the band&rsquo;s own sound developing on that album. In the five years between its release and <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em>&rsquo;s, those seeds have fully taken root and flowered more beautifully than I could&rsquo;ve imagined possible. To be clear, this isn&rsquo;t an album people will, on its surface, describe as &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;. Its dominant emotion is justifiable fury at the state of the world, which is intrinsic to its subject matter. Where we might say <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em> focuses on the political as personal, as part of its protagonist&rsquo;s personal development towards understanding the legacy of empire, we might say <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> focuses on the personal as political: your suffering isn&rsquo;t accidental; it&rsquo;s a direct consequence of how the system has been deliberately constructed. As <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;The Law of Asbestos&rdquo;</span> (one of the best album openers I&rsquo;ve ever heard, by the way) puts it, <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;This is not a house of amateurs; this is done with full intent.&rdquo;</span></p>

		<p class="fixheight">The lyrics to <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em> were often abstract and poetic; it wasn&rsquo;t an apolitical album (indeed, it announced its politics on its very cover, and the band has always self-identified as Red/Anarchist Black Metal), but the cover aside, its politics were implicit, found under a sea of abstraction. <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em>&rsquo;s stance is explicitly anarchist; its entire edifice, if you&rsquo;ll pardon the obvious architecture metaphor, is its stance that the entire system is rotten from the foundation up, designed to enrich the few at the expense of the many. The only ethical solution is to demolish the power structures that perpetuate these inequalities and replace them with a system founded on just, equitable distribution of power &ndash; in short, anarchy (and not the popular misconception of <em>chaos</em>: <em class="weight3 accent">anarchy</em> is simply an Anglicisation of the Greek <em class="weight2 toc-counter">ἀναρχίᾱ</em>, or <em class="weight2 toc-counter">anarkhíā</em>, formed from <em class="weight2 toc-counter">ἀν</em> for <em class="weight2 toc-counter">without</em>, <em class="weight2 toc-counter">ᾰ̓ρχή</em> for <em class="weight2 toc-counter">rulership</em>, and <em class="weight2 toc-counter">ίᾱ</em> to form an abstract noun; thus, <em class="weight3 accent">anarchy</em> means <em class="weight3 accent">the lack of rulers</em>).</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve thus far only alluded to <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em>&rsquo;s musical style because the shift in <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s style since <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em> is inextricably linked to their shift in subject matter. They often sounded like <span class="weight2 toc-counter">A Forest of Stars</span> on <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em> because that&rsquo;s the natural sound for a progressive black metal band to take when focusing on the Victorian era. Here, they focus on modern urban structures, both physical and metaphorical; it wouldn&rsquo;t do at all to sound like <span class="weight2 toc-counter">A Forest of Stars</span> here.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Thus, <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> is much bleaker; the saxophone often feels reminiscent of the dark jazz we might associate with urban landscapes. (I&rsquo;m sure <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span> will receive comparisons to <span class="weight3 accent">White Ward</span>, but as obvious as and as flattering the comparison might be, and as likely as it is that <span class="weight3 accent">White Ward</span> was an influence, they <em>feel</em> very different &ndash; <span class="weight2 toc-counter">White Ward</span> is primarily depressive where <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> is primarily furious.) <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> has a strong industrial element (they&rsquo;ll probably also receive comparisons to Norway&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">Shining</span>, especially given the saxophone; that feels slightly closer to the mark, but they&rsquo;re still quite different), and at times they delve into folk as well: <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Law of Asbestos&rdquo;</span> contains hammered dulcimer from <span class="weight3 accent">Botanist</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">Otrebor</span> (whose band rules, by the way), alongside <span class="weight3 accent">James Johnson</span>&rsquo;s violin and <span class="weight3 accent">Matthew Johnson</span>&rsquo;s saxophone, which gives its opening movement a bit of a Celtic folk metal feel. But the dominant style is utterly furious avant-garde/industrial black metal.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">The only comparisons I can make for most of the album are to <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Teethed Glory and Injury</em>, or much of <span class="weight3 accent">Blut aus Nord</span>&rsquo;s work, but while I rank both in the upper echelon of avant-garde/black metal, the comparison feels inadequate. As soon as I heard the album, I immediately had suspicions that both <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Teethed Glory</em> and <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Blut aus Nord</span> influenced it (and indeed, <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Alasdair Dunn</span> has since confirmed <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Teethed Glory</em>&rsquo;s influence), but it&rsquo;s quite different from either. It&rsquo;s, in many ways, where <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span> had to go after <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Laudanum Quandary</em>: having examined the past&rsquo;s impacts on the present day, it was the logical next step to examine the present day itself. I doubt either <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Altar of Plagues</span> or <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Blut aus Nord</span> would much disagree with Ashenspire&rsquo;s bleak depiction of the world (<span class="weight2 toc-counter">Blut aus Nord</span>&rsquo;s work is rarely openly political, but mastermind <span class="weight3 accent">Vindsval</span> has denounced nationalism and said his political views resemble <span class="weight3 accent">Wolves in the Throne Room</span>&rsquo;s), but neither has ever written an album this overtly political.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">These are some of the best metal lyrics I have ever heard, of quality comparable to <span class="weight3 accent">Deathspell Omega</span>&rsquo;s and <span class="weight3 accent">Pyrrhon</span>&rsquo;s. Here&rsquo;s the closing segment to <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Law of Asbestos&rdquo;</span>:</p>

		<blockquote class="fixheight toc-counter"><p>Always three months to the gutter,<br />
			Never three months to the peak.<br />
			Another day to grind your fingers<br />
			For the simple right to eat.</p>
			<p>Always three months to the gutter,<br />
			Never three months to the crown.<br />
			Another deep breath of asbestos<br />
			In a godforsaken town.</p>
			<p>Always three months to the gutter,<br />
			Never three months to the top.<br />
			Another set of fucking homeless spikes<br />
			Outside another empty shop.</p>
			<p>Always three months to the gutter,<br />
			Never three months to ascent.<br />
			This is not a house of amateurs.<br />
			This is done with full intent.</p></blockquote>	

		<p class="fixheight">Simple, direct, and powerful &ndash; it&rsquo;s some of the most effective use of repetition I&rsquo;ve ever heard in a metal song.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">Dunn&rsquo;s delivery throughout the album sounds like a furious <span class="weight3 accent">Twelfth Doctor</span> channelling the <em>Sprechgesang</em> of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Mr Doctor</span> (<span class="weight3 accent">Peter Capaldi</span> and <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Alasdair Dunn</span> are both Glaswegian, so their similar speech cadences are not coincidental; and as <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span> explicitly cites <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Devil Doll</span> as an influence, the similarity to <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Mr Doctor</span>&rsquo;s manner of delivery is undoubtedly not coincidental either). His delivery of the above passage is full of seemingly every bit of the fury the lyrics demand, and the music backs it up. Then the band doubles the tempo, and <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Dunn</span> repeats the passage even more furiously.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">A note for non-British listeners: The line <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;Grenfell burns again&rdquo;</span> refers to the <span class="weight3 accent">Grenfell Tower fire of 2017-07-14</span>, which killed 72 people. The fire was exacerbated by faulty cladding that was widely used throughout Britain; in its aftermath, <span class="weight3 accent">Dame Judith Hackett</span> wrote that the entire British building regulatory system was <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;not fit for purpose&rdquo;</span>, and by June 2020, some 2,000 high-rise buildings had been identified as at risk of similar fires. The British government pledged &pound;5 billion to remediate fire safety problems, which still fell far short of the costs incurred; many were thus borne by flat owners who&rsquo;d believed the properties they&rsquo;d bought had been properly built.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I could write an entire essay just on <span class="weight2 toc-counter">&ldquo;The Law of Asbestos&rdquo;</span>, but that would leave the rest of the album to cover. However, I&rsquo;m not going to write a track-by-track review or note every highlight; I&rsquo;ve gushed for long enough as it is, and I don&rsquo;t mean to spoil every pleasant surprise it has to offer. (Plus, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a 100% to an album if I didn&rsquo;t consider the entire album to be a highlight.) The title <em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> may derive from architecture designed to produce physical discomfort, but clearly, the album doesn&rsquo;t merely focus on literal physical examples of hostile architecture; its thesis is that <em>society&rsquo;s entire edifice</em> is hostile architecture. And it&rsquo;s full of fantastic lines like <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;When you can&rsquo;t see the stars, you stop dreaming of space&rdquo;</span> (<span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Béton Brut&rdquo;</span>) and <span class="toc-counter">&ldquo;There are no great men, only the great many&rdquo;</span> (<span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Tragic Heroin&rdquo;</span>). The arrangements, songwriting, and performances are universally impeccable, but I need to single out <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Dunn</span>&rsquo;s drumming in particular &ndash; it&rsquo;s phenomenal.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">One of the album&rsquo;s most-discussed tracks has been the interlude <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;How the Mighty Have Vision&rdquo;</span>, where <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Dunn</span> is joined by a four-part choir consisting of <span class="weight3 accent">Rylan Gleave</span> and <span class="weight3 accent">Maud the Moth</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">Amaya López-Carromero</span>. It&rsquo;s a fascinating change of pace, and one of the few times <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Dunn</span> sings on the album &ndash; and he uses the expected traditional black metal rasp even less often. His dominant vocal style is <em>Sprechgesang</em>, which helps the album&rsquo;s message hit all the harder, since his words are all (despite his obvious Glasgow accent) clearly enunciated in the manner of an angry sermon.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I need to single out one further highlight: the closer <span class="weight3 accent">&ldquo;Cable Street Again&rdquo;</span>, named for the <span class="weight3 accent">Battle of Cable Street</span>, a confrontation on <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Cable Street</span> in London&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">East End</span> between some 2,000 to 5,000 members of <span class="weight3 accent">Oswald Mosley</span>&rsquo;s <span class="weight3 accent">British Union of Fascists</span> and between 100,000 and over 310,000 <span class="weight3 accent">antifascist counterdemonstrators</span>. <span class="weight2 toc-counter">East End</span> at the time had a large Jewish population, and some 100,000 East Londoners had signed a <span class="weight3 accent">Jewish People&rsquo;s Council</span> petition asking for the march to be banned. Ultimately, the vast number of counterdemonstrators led the police to call the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">BUF</span> to march in the West End instead. Although the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">BUF</span>&rsquo;s membership went up in the immediate wake of <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Cable Street</span>, it fatally sank their cause in the long run; <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Mosley</span>&rsquo;s image as a strong leader was indelibly tarnished by the event, and ultimately the <span class="weight3 accent">Public Order Act of 1936</span> banned the wearing of political uniforms like the <span class="weight3 accent">Blackshirts</span>&rsquo; and required police permission for large gatherings such as the BUF&rsquo;s march.</p>

		<p class="fixheight">But that was 1936, and today&rsquo;s feckless politicians can&rsquo;t be relied upon to suppress Fascism. Indeed, if the <span class="weight2 toc-counter">BUF</span> hadn&rsquo;t faced such public opposition, it&rsquo;s unlikely that Britain&rsquo;s leaders at the time would&rsquo;ve taken such strong steps either. Fascists took over Italy and Germany through legal means &ndash; unethical, but legal. The state can&rsquo;t be relied upon to protect us, and the current state of society is no accident; it&rsquo;s the result of a system working as intended. <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Dunn</span> says:</p>
			
		<blockquote class="fixheight toc-counter">
			<p>The violence is here: modern Blackshirts in the streets.<br />
			What good is civility in the face of a kerb full of teeth?<br />
			&rsquo;Tis no broken system, but the product of it.<br />
			You cannot fix that which is working as intended.<br />
			Gnashing-toothed printing press, virulent, caustic.<br />
			They bound the fasces themselves, sharpened the axe.<br />
			Know this: they aren&rsquo;t resting, nor reading the rules.<br />
			They&rsquo;re desperate for war, gagging for it.<br />
			If it&rsquo;s to be Cable Street again, we won&rsquo;t win through debate.<br />
			You can&rsquo;t reason with malice. The fasces must break!</p>

			<p class="fixheight">If this is against the grain, then the blight really has set in.<br />
			The furrowing of brows and the festering of blame, misshapen and bent.<br />
			It&rsquo;s not the fucking corner shop that drives up your rent.<br />
			They salted the soil! Buried up to your neck in the debts of your station.<br />
			But this is where it ends. There&rsquo;s no middle road.<br />
			And I tell you:<br />
			Get down off the fence<br />
			Before the barbed wire goes up!</p></blockquote>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve written thousands of words about this album, and yet in truth, nothing I say could sum up its greatness better than <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s own words do. The best I can hope is to provide exegesis.</p>

		<p class="fixheight bottompara"><em class="weight2 toc-counter">Hostile Architecture</em> is quite likely to be my album of the year, and possibly of the decade. It&rsquo;s immediately bracing on first listen and reveals further depth on subsequent ones. Its songwriting, arrangement, performance, originality, and lyrics are beyond reproach and not merely supplement but provide foundations for each other. Its form and style are results of its content, and its content makes its form and style even more effective. It&rsquo;s inventive because of its style and form, and because no metal album has addressed these problems as directly, as effectively, or as ingeniously. <span class="weight2 toc-counter">Ashenspire</span>&rsquo;s message is urgent and vital, and by wrapping it in one of the most satisfying listens I&rsquo;ve heard this year or any other, they&rsquo;ve given it a power and urgency that are not merely refreshing but necessary.</p>
