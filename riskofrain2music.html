<h1 class="petitecaps centred upperpara">Aaron Freed vs. the <em>Risk of Rain</em> Stems</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a couple of songs that incorporate some of Chris Christodoulou&rsquo;s stems from <em>RoR2</em>. They aren&rsquo;t quite complete yet, but they&rsquo;re in strong enough states that I feel comfortable sharing them.</p>

<h3 class="centred midpara">&ldquo;Landing&rdquo; / &ldquo;The Rain Formerly Known as Purple&rdquo; / &ldquo;A Glacier Eventually Farts&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The first is a mash-up of &ldquo;The Rain Formerly Known as Purple&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Glacier Eventually Farts&rdquo; with Alexander Seropian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Landing&rdquo; from Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (1994), which I made for a <em>Marathon</em> mod called <em>Eternal</em>. The moment I learned that Chris had released the <em>RoR2</em> stems, I knew I&rsquo;d inevitably make this mashup &ndash; I&rsquo;d noticed the similarity between the melodies the very first time I heard &ldquo;The Rain Formerly Known as Purple&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll know what i mean the moment you get to the relevant point of this track. This is a very <em>Blade Runner</em>-inspired collaboration with another arranger who uses the name wowbobwow, and I&rsquo;m very pleased with how different the <em>RoR2</em> stems feel in this context.</p>

<p>(This also briefly interpolates the drum intro from Nirvana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scentless Apprentice&rdquo; at a few points, and the ending briefly quotes Mick Gordon&rsquo;s &ldquo;They Only Thing They Fear Is You&rdquo;. <em>Marathon Eternal</em>, <em>Doom Eternal</em>, get it? I&rsquo;m fairly sure I was legally obligated.)</p>

<p>I sent this to Chris earlier this week; his feedback was overall quite positive, and he provided some insightful suggestions that I&rsquo;ll incorporate the next time I work on this mix. I&rsquo;d been thinking of doing more mash-ups with <em>Marathon</em> songs, but he suggested instead writing original songs that incorporated his stems. I&rsquo;d been too intimidated to even try that until he suggested it, but I sat down, loaded a few stems from &ldquo;The Raindrop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo; into Logic, and began writing parts &ndash; which I found surprisingly easy.</p>

<h3 class="centred midpara">&ldquo;Ὁ ζῐ́γγος αὔξεται μέγᾰς / Ὀνειροπολεῖς τῆς βῐαίᾱς αὐξήσεος&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The second track, which I&rsquo;m writing for a different <em>Marathon</em> mod called <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>, is the result. (On the very slim chance that anyone that reads this is familiar with the original <em>Tempus Irae</em>, I&rsquo;m planning to use it on the level &ldquo;Downward Spiral&rdquo;.) It&rsquo;s also not finished yet, but its basic skeleton has by now taken form. It&rsquo;s divided cleanly into two movements, with a heavy mood shift between them; the dividing line is where I start also incorporating stems from &ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo;. this is a very jarring transition, and I think I like it that way (though I&rsquo;ll probably add more reverb).</p>

<p>What shocked me is how perfectly the second half of &ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo; fit over the solo from the second half of &ldquo;The Raindrop That Fell to the Sky&rdquo; &ndash; I could tell there was probably enough harmonic overlap between them for a mash-up of the tracks to work, but I didn&rsquo;t expect to just be able to loop parts from &ldquo;They Might as Well Be Dead&rdquo; over the entire solo once I&rsquo;d pitch-shifted and time-stretched them. But that&rsquo;s exactly what wound up happening. The result feels stylistically somewhere between Pink Floyd, Vangelis, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Nine Inch Nails (four of my favorite artists, incidentally).</p>

<p>Right now, the second half is <em>entirely</em> stems from the two <em>RoR2</em> tracks, but I plan to write original parts to flesh out the arrangement further and add some more texture. I&rsquo;ll also undoubtedly merge in elements of a few additional <em>RoR</em> tracks &ndash; definitely at least &ldquo;Moisture Deficit&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;Once in a Lullaby&rdquo; if I can get it to fit.</p>

<p>The titles are my undoubtedly amateurish attempts at translating &ldquo;The whirring grows loud&rdquo; and &ldquo;You dream of violent growth&rdquo; to ancient Greek, a language that I just barely know enough to be dangerous in. (<em>Marathon</em> is literally a Greek name, after all, so I find it especially fitting to use Greek for these titles.)</p>
