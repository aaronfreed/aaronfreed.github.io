		<h1 class="petitecaps centred">Soundtracks &amp; Remixes for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> Trilogy</h1>

		<p class="fixheight">This is a list of (mostly) completed soundtracks for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (<span class="date">1994</span>) and its sequels, plus fan games for Aleph One, the open-source continuation of the <em>Marathon</em> engine. With the exception of <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>, <em>Eternal X</em> 1.3, and <em>hellpak vol. 2</em>&rsquo;s monster work-in-progress soundtracks, I&rsquo;ve attempted to keep this predominantly to completed or almost-completed projects. (I&rsquo;m still revising my Logic Pro mixes, but they&rsquo;re subsequent revisions of albums that contain all sixteen tracks from the original game; conversely, some twenty years later, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say Tobacco or Cannibal Whore Feast are each highly unlikely to do additional remixes, and they do give you all sixteen tracks of the OST between them.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">A quick note on file formats: Usually, FLAC is for listening outside the game, and MP3 or Ogg Vorbis for use within it. (Aleph One 1.6.1, released <span class="date">2023-01-19</span>, was the first version to play FLAC, and it only does so with MML and Lua scripts; thus, it&rsquo;d take some work to get it to play FLAC with <em>Marathon 1</em> maps.) I use &lsquo;upmastered FLAC&rsquo; to denote that I didn&rsquo;t have a lossless source and made a facsimile. I explained my process in a document included with the <em>Eternal</em> 1.2 OST, which I&rsquo;ve <a href="remastering.html">reproduced with edits</a> for clarity, brevity, &amp; the insights I&rsquo;ve gained from five subsequent years of working with sound. (Also, acknowledgements to <strong>Solra Bizna</strong> for the term &lsquo;upmaster&rsquo;, which is a more descriptive term than my previous choice, &lsquo;pseudo-FLAC&rsquo;.)</p>

		<p class="fixheight">I&rsquo;ve endeavoured to list release dates as accurately as possible. All dates are ISO 8601 (the objectively correct format): thus, <strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong>, <strong>yyyy-mm</strong>, or simply <strong>yyyy</strong>, depending on the specificity of the information I possess.</p>

		<p class="fixheight" id="remasterinfo">Those curious about my remastering process for the releases found below may wish to consult <a href="remastering.html">my notes on my remastering process</a>, which now have their own page. Those interested in making their own content for Aleph One may also be interested in my <a href="mapmaking101.html">introduction to mapmaking</a> and <a href="mapmaking.html">more advanced guide</a>.

		<h3 id="m1remixes"><em>Marathon 1</em> Remixes</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Craig Hardgrove&rsquo;s site</a> has a massive number of these. Except as noted, the following <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> on his site, and unless otherwise noted, they all contain at least one remix of every track in <em>Marathon 1</em>&rsquo;s OST:</p>
		<ul class="fixheight">
			<li><strong><strong id="qtstereo">QuickTime 2.0/2.5 stereo</strong></strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcWHHYsoNk8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://dropbox.com/sh/2ph95u9cvid5c5s/AACsQ0IVzHPsCxAT_B-xRkoda?dl=1">FLAC</a>. QuickTime 2.0 in the left channel, QuickTime 2.5 in the right. Technically, these could be counted as my second remixes of the OST (I released them on <span class="date">2021-02-03</span>), but I&rsquo;ve listed them first because they&rsquo;re so similar in sound to the OST that they barely qualify as remixes.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="aaron1997">Aaron Freed</strong> (<span class="date">1997</span> QuickTime 2.5 remixes)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/qVecMMHALOI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="music/marathon1997.html" target="_blank">FLAC</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8sxqhekhmknac2/Aaron Freed - Marathon Remixes %28ogg%29.zip?dl=1">Ogg Vorbis</a> (see also <a href="discography.html">my complete discography</a>). My first remixes. Extremely faithful to the original sound, adding only stereo, reverb, new instruments, and a few other flourishes</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="tobacco">Tobacco</strong> (<span class="date">2001-07-24</span>):</strong> <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggsZwUnGHpiNhFQp?e=zLoLw2" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks: 
				<ol>
					<li>Chomber</li>
					<li>Fat Man</li>
					<li>Flowers in Heaven</li>
					<li>Landing</li>
					<li>Leela</li>
					<li>Rushing</li>
					<li>Splash (Marathon)</li>
					<li>Swirls</li>
				</ol>
			Wonderful remakes that add some tasteful &ndash; and tasty &ndash; new instrumental parts.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="chibi-usa">Chibi-usa</strong> (<span class="date">2002-03-11</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgzV_SUjc5srN7I2z?e=hC36Kn" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="cannibalwhorefeast">Cannibal Whore Feast</strong> (<span class="date">2003-08-12</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggq6dI494c5fnmyq?e=JUvMXd" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks:
				<ol>
					<li>Aliens Again</li>
					<li>Flippant</li>
					<li>Freedom</li>
					<li>Guardians</li>
					<li>New Pacific</li>
					<li>New Pacific (reprise)</li>
					<li>Rapture</li>
					<li>What About Bob?</li>
				</ol>
			Like Chibi-usa&rsquo;s, these are tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer. And you can combine these with Tobacco&rsquo;s for another complete set of remixes.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="eternalx"><em>Eternal X</em></strong> (<span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref01" title="Eternal X 1.0 was released on 2008-02-23, 1.0.1 on 2008-02-24, 1.0.2 on 2008-02-29, 1.0.3 on 2008-03-01, and 1.1 on 2015-10-26. See footnote 2 for Eternal 1.2&rsquo;s release history; Eternal&rsquo;s development page for release dates of all past versions of the game, including betas and the Mark versions (which are to Eternal X roughly what the Apotheosis beta is to Apotheosis X or what The Gray Incident is to Phoenix); and Eternal 1.3&rsquo;s manual for a historical breakdown of what tracks were used on what level in each major release. Most of Craig and Nick&rsquo;s tracks were present in 1.0; 1.1 added Tommy&rsquo;s tracks and a few more by Craig."><span class="date">2008-02-23</span><a href="#ftnt01" class="normal">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>):</strong> A soundtrack that has grown and expanded with each 1.x release.
				<ul>
					<li><strong><strong id="eternal1.2"><em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 OST</strong> (<span id="note2ref" class="dotted" title="Eternal X 1.2.0 itself came out on 2019-03-28, but we first released its OST on 2018-12-21 to commemorate Marathon&rsquo;s 24th anniversary. Eternal X 1.2.1 came out on 2021-11-07."><span class="date">2018-12-21</span><a href="#ftnt02" class="normal">&#8317;&sup2;&#8318;</a></span>)</strong>: <a href="music/eternal1.2ost.html" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Craig&rsquo;s site has the <a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/music/eternal_remastered/Marathon_Eternal_OST_Remastered.zip">Ogg Vorbis files</a> (but if you have <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 or 1.2.1, you already have most of these anyway) and a link to the <a href="https://youtu.be/LbkpMAZuOk0">YouTube video</a>. These probably remain the most famous and acclaimed remakes of the OST.</li>
					<li><p><strong><strong id="eternal1.3"><em>(WIP) Eternal X</em> 1.3 OST</strong> (likely to be released sometime in <span class="date">2024</span> or <span class="date">2025</span>)</strong>: Over seven hours of music by some thirteen contributors, mostly drawing from the <em>Marathon 1</em> soundtrack. There&rsquo;s some overlap with several composers&rsquo; work below, but some of these tracks have been revised, remixed, or remastered for <em>Eternal</em> 1.3, and since they frequently segue seamlessly into one another, you probably won&rsquo;t have heard most of them in these exact configurations before. The OST has been updated and expanded substantially even in recent months, and several of these mixes are unique to <em>Eternal</em> 1.3.</p>
					
					<p>There are two different versions of this soundtrack, which should not be confused as they serve different purposes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Original Soundtrack (OST):</strong> <a href="music/eternal1.3ost.html" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a> (depending on track). Meant for listening outside the game; the quietest sections are left at their original volume levels, and tracks that loop in-game will loop past the loop point and then fade out. The level music for &ldquo;We Met Once in the Garden&rdquo; (which changes over the course of the level dynamically based on in-game events) is combined into a single track. Filenames contain track numbers and spaces.</li>
							<li><strong>In-game soundtrack:</strong> <a href="music/eternal1.3ingame.html" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a> (depending on track). For use in-game with 1.3 preview 6. Tracks that loop in-game will cut off suddenly if played in an audio player, and I made the quietest sections of a few tracks louder so they&rsquo;ll be audible over the game sound effects. The level music for &ldquo;We Met Once in the Garden&rdquo; is split into three tracks. Tracks are grouped into folders, and the filenames are less useful.</li>
						</ul>
					<p class="lowerpara">Note that <em>Eternal</em> 1.3&rsquo;s soundtrack incorporates tracks that appear in several other collections here, including Craig Hardgrove&rsquo;s <em>Somewhere in the Heavens</em>, Talashar&rsquo;s <em>Eupfhoria</em>, CKT1138 and Matrix_XV&rsquo;s remixes, my <span class="date">1997</span> remixes, and <em>See You Starside</em> (and its related albums).</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="somewhereintheheavens">Craig Hardgrove &ndash; <em>Marathon: Somewhere in the Heavens</em></strong> (<span class="date">2011-07-18</span>)</strong>: The bulk of <em>Eternal</em>&rsquo;s soundtrack prior to 1.3, and still a major component of it in 1.3.
				<ul>
					<li><strong><span class="date">2024-01-23</span> remaster</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRsTPy99NcfhHI4ITI?e=Oc6QE9" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a>. Remasters of higher-quality sources of seventeen tracks from <em>Eternal</em> 1.2&rsquo;s soundtrack. Eleven tracks have lossless AIFF sources; I&rsquo;ve upmastered the other six (&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;, &ldquo;Aliens Again&rdquo;, &ldquo;What About Bob?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;, &ldquo;New Pacific&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Splash (Marathon)&rdquo;), which were lossy M4A. In addition, I&rsquo;ve declipped most tracks to mitigate clipping distortion. These are likely the highest-quality versions of these tracks I’ll be able to make until I&rsquo;m able to re-export the original project files in GarageBand 1.1.0 and 3.0.5 sans clipping; however, a few project files have missing loops, and if we can&rsquo;t locate them, I may be unable to remaster them all perfectly.</li>
					<li><strong>GarageBand source files & original exports</strong> (released <span class="date">2024-01-15</span>): <a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/music/source/CH_remakes_source.zip">AIFF, M4A, MP3, & .band</a> via <a href="https://www.themarathonmusic.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Craig&rsquo;s website</a>. Note that the link to the source files on his downloads page actually just links to the original MP3 releases; he posted the correct link on his news page.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="willchristian">Will Christian</strong> (<span class="date">2016-10-17</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/will-christian-2/albums" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqWzoS5s5Rk1hxIyW?e=z3CJ7s" target="_blank">remastered FLAC</a>. Some interesting, inventive takes. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought to rearrange &lsquo;Leela&rsquo; as a metal track, but&hellip; somehow, it works.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="eupfhoria">Talashar &ndash; <em>Eupfhoria</em></strong> (<span class="date">2018-11-18</span>)</strong>: <a href="http://talashar.bandcamp.com/album/eupfhoria" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> (stream, FLAC, other formats). Atmospheric reorchestrations that add new layers of harmony and melody, resulting in some fantastic twists on old classics.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="ckt1138">CKT1138</strong> (<span class="date">2021-03-12</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/7uadHRPqrec" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-ost-2021-3" target="_blank">FLAC & Ogg Vorbis</a>. Faithful reorchestrations using vintage &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s synthesizers, with a sound worthy of Vangelis&rsquo; <em>Blade Runner</em> OST on several tracks.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="matrix_xv">Matrix_XV</strong> (<span class="date">2022-08-28</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1ZSRa3ff5Bw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRslriHZhx_M88OkRM?e=Ez4ndE" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgdcSfbanLwP2fWYFmQ?e=aqFboT" target="_blank">Ogg Vorbis/MP3</a>. Lush, generally faithful remakes with modern synthesizers, and the points of departure, like the Black Sabbath-inspired take on &lsquo;Landing&rsquo;, are superb.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="seeyoustarsaide">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>See You Starside: The Marathon Soundtrack Reimagined</em></strong> (<span class="date">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="music/seeyoustarside.html" target="_blank">FLAC & Ogg Vorbis</a>. My latest complete <em>Marathon</em> OST arrangement album, made from <span class="date">2022-12</span> to <span class="date">2021-01</span> in GarageBand. Also available: my <a href="music/marathonpistolstarts.html" target="_blank">first drafts</a> (from <span class="date">2022-12-05</span>), <a href="music/marathon2022-2023.html" target="_blank">interim revisions</a>, and <a href="discography.html">complete discography</a>. The <span class="date">2022-12-05</span> tracks are &rsquo;70s/&rsquo;80s-style remixes inspired by <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;used future&rsquo; aesthetic.
				<p class="lowerpara">I&rsquo;d already planned to take creative liberties with the OST&rsquo;s sound when I started, but as I gained familiarity with GarageBand&rsquo;s surprisingly robust feature set, I took steadily more, heavily expanding many tracks almost to a &ldquo;complete rewrite&rdquo; extent (<em>See You Starside</em> adds some thirty-eight minutes to the OST&rsquo;s running time, and nine tracks are more than twice as long as the originals). Samples of Roland drum machines and Mellotrons are ubiquitous. The primary influences on this album are &rsquo;70s progressive rock, &rsquo;80s pop, &rsquo;90s Japanese game music, and &rsquo;90s/&rsquo;00s post-rock; secondary influences include metal, jazz, blues, classical, disco, ambient, Gregorian chant, electronic music, and film and TV soundtracks.
					<ul>
						<li>You can also listen to <em>See You Starside</em> on <a href="https://youtu.be/bRiDh3PziWU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but if you do, <em>please</em> use an adblocker (e.g., uBlock Origin), as I neither want advertisements on this video nor receive any money from them.</li>
						<li><strong><strong id="violinsagain">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>Violins Again: An Orchestral Marathon Soundtrack</em></strong> (<span class="date">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="music/violinsagain.html" target="_blank">FLAC</a>. The above mixes&rsquo; &lsquo;orchestral&rsquo; counterpart (though, as I can&rsquo;t afford to hire an actual orchestra, it&rsquo;s really every bit as synthetic). Most of the melodies are identical, but the instrumentation favours violins, harps, and pianos over guitars or synthesizers (though this is not a universal rule). Occasionally, the orchestra is more eastern (you&rsquo;ll hear a koto on several tracks and a sitar on at least one), or may involve electric violins, viole, celli, or basses; unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the involvement of any electric light orchestrae. I don&rsquo;t really like this title, but I never thought of a better one.</li>
						<li><strong><strong id="andbeyond">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>&hellip;And Beyond: The Marathon Future Symphonic Mixes</em></strong> (<span class="date">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="music/andbeyond.html" target="_blank">FLAC</a>. The result of combining <em>See You Starside</em> with <em>Violins Again</em>. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t really like this title either, but again, I never thought of anything better. The subtitle is at least justifiable in that, by the time <em>Marathon</em> takes place, genres like rock, jazz, and even hip-hop and metal will probably be lumped in with Classical music the way we lump Baroque, Romantic, and even Modernist music in with &lsquo;Classical&rsquo;, even though the Classical period was properly only from ca. <span class="date">1750</span> to ca. <span class="date">1820</span>.</li>
						<li><a href="music/seeyoustarsidemk2.html" target="_blank" id="aaronlogic">WIP revisions</a> of the above sets using Logic Pro and EastWest ComposerCloud+ instruments. I composed and arranged the above sets entirely in GarageBand and, with only four exceptions, used GarageBand or MainStage instruments &ndash; I wanted to show that it needn&rsquo;t cost a fortune to make music that sounds good. (<em>Violins Again</em> and <em>&hellip;And Beyond</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aliens Again&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chomber&rsquo; use ComposerCloud+ instruments. MainStage is an entirely reasonable $50, and GarageBand comes free with every Mac.) I&rsquo;m now revising them with professional-grade software and instrumentation, but note that several tracks currently have significant instrument balance issues; I&rsquo;ll fix these in subsequent revisions.</li>
