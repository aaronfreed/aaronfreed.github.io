		<h1>Remixes & Fan Soundtracks for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (<span class="number">1994</span>)</h1>

		<p>This is a list of (mostly) completed soundtracks for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (<span class="number">1994</span>) and its sequels, plus fan games for Aleph One, the open-source continuation of the <em>Marathon</em> engine. With the exception of <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em>, <em>Eternal X</em> 1.3, and <em>hellpak vol. <span class="number">2</span></em>&rsquo;s monster work-in-progress soundtracks, I&rsquo;ve attempted to keep this predominantly to completed or almost-completed projects. (I&rsquo;m still revising my Logic Pro mixes, but they&rsquo;re subsequent revisions of albums that contain all sixteen tracks from the original game; conversely, some twenty years later, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say Tobacco or Cannibal Whore Feast are each highly unlikely to do additional remixes, and they do give you all sixteen tracks of the OST between them.)</p>

		<p>A quick note on file formats: Usually, FLAC is for listening outside the game, and MP3 or Ogg Vorbis for use within it. (Aleph One 1.6.1, released <span class="number">2023-01-19</span>, was the first version to play FLAC, and it only does so with MML and Lua scripts; thus, it&rsquo;d take some work to get it to play FLAC with <em>Marathon <span class="number">1</span></em> maps.) I use &lsquo;upmastered FLAC&rsquo; to denote that I didn&rsquo;t have a lossless source and made a facsimile. I explained my process in a document included with the <em>Eternal</em> 1.2 OST; I&rsquo;ve reproduced it below, with edits to add clarity, brevity, &amp; the insights I&rsquo;ve gained from five subsequent years of working with sound. (Also, acknowledgements to <strong>Solra Bizna</strong> for the term &lsquo;upmaster&rsquo;, which is a more descriptive term than my previous choice, &lsquo;pseudo-FLAC&rsquo;.)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve endeavoured to list release dates as accurately as possible. All dates are ISO 8601 (the objectively correct format): thus, depending on the specificity of the information I possess, they&rsquo;re <strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong>, <strong>yyyy-mm</strong>, or simply <strong>yyyy</strong>.</p>

If what you&rsquo;re looking for isn&rsquo;t on this page, you may want to check <a href="discography.html">my discography page</a> (which contains some <em>Marathon</em> music that I haven&rsquo;t yet listed here) or my <a href="portfolio.html">creative portfolio</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="m1"><em>Marathon <span class="number">1</span></em> Remixes</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Craig Hardgrove&rsquo;s site</a> has a massive number of these. Except as noted, the following <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> on his site, and unless otherwise noted, they all contain at least one remix of every track in <em>Marathon <span class="number">1</span></em>&rsquo;s OST:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><strong id="qtstereo">QuickTime <span class="number">2</span>.<span class="number">0</span>/<span class="number">2</span>.<span class="number">5</span> stereo</strong></strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcWHHYsoNk8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://dropbox.com/sh/2ph95u9cvid5c5s/AACsQ0IVzHPsCxAT_B-xRkoda?dl=1">FLAC</a>. QuickTime 2.0 in the left channel, QuickTime 2.5 in the right. Technically, these could be counted as my second remixes of the OST (I released them on 2021-02-03), but I&rsquo;ve listed them first because they&rsquo;re so similar in sound to the OST that they barely qualify as remixes.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="aaron1997">Aaron Freed</strong> (<span class="number">1997</span> QuickTime <span class="number">2</span>.<span class="number">5</span> remixes)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/qVecMMHALOI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hwjjj5jew565fd/Aaron Freed - Marathon Remixes.rar?dl=1">FLAC</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8sxqhekhmknac2/Aaron Freed - Marathon Remixes %28ogg%29.zip?dl=1">Ogg Vorbis</a> (see also <a href="discography.html">my complete discography</a>). My first remixes. Extremely faithful to the original sound, adding only stereo, reverb, new instruments, and a few other flourishes</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="tobacco">Tobacco</strong> (<span class="number">2001-07-24</span>):</strong> <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggsZwUnGHpiNhFQp?e=zLoLw2" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks: 
				<ol>
					<li>Chomber</li>
					<li>Fat Man</li>
					<li>Flowers in Heaven</li>
					<li>Landing</li>
					<li>Leela</li>
					<li>Rushing</li>
					<li>Splash (Marathon)</li>
					<li>Swirls</li>
				</ol>
			Wonderful remakes that add some tasteful – and tasty – new instrumental parts.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="chibi-usa">Chibi-usa</strong> (<span class="number">2002-03-11</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgzV_SUjc5srN7I2z?e=hC36Kn" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="cannibalwhorefeast">Cannibal Whore Feast</strong> (<span class="number">2003-08-12</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggq6dI494c5fnmyq?e=JUvMXd" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks:
				<ol>
					<li>Aliens Again</li>
					<li>Flippant</li>
					<li>Freedom</li>
					<li>Guardians</li>
					<li>New Pacific</li>
					<li>New Pacific (reprise)</li>
					<li>Rapture</li>
					<li>What About Bob?</li>
				</ol>
			Like Chibi-usa&rsquo;s, these are tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer. And you can combine these with Tobacco&rsquo;s for another complete set of remixes.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="willchristian">Will Christian</strong> (<span class="number">2016-10-17</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/will-christian-2/albums" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqWzoS5s5Rk1hxIyW?e=z3CJ7s" target="_blank">remastered FLAC</a>. Some interesting, inventive takes. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought to rearrange &lsquo;Leela&rsquo; as a metal track, but&hellip; somehow, it works.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="eupfhoria">Talashar &ndash; <em>Eupfhoria</em></strong> (<span class="number">2018-11-18</span>)</strong>: <a href="http://talashar.bandcamp.com/album/eupfhoria" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> (streaming, FLAC, nearly any other format you want). Atmospheric reorchestrations that add new layers of harmony and melody, resulting in some fantastic twists on old classics.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="eternal1.2"><em>Eternal X</em> <span class="number">1</span>.<span class="number">2</span> OST</strong> (<span id="note1ref" class="dotted number" title="While Eternal X 1.2.0 was not released until 2019-03-28, its OST was first released on 2018-12-21 to commemorate Marathon&rsquo;s 24th anniversary.">2018-12-21<a href="#note1">&#8317;<span class="number">&sup1;</span>&#8318;</a></span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggmThH4ilUengJ2J" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>. Craig&rsquo;s site has the <a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/music/eternal_remastered/Marathon_Eternal_OST_Remastered.zip">Ogg Vorbis files</a> (but if you have <em>Eternal X</em> <span class="number">1.2</span> or <span class="number">1.2.1</span>, you already have most of these anyway) and a link to the <a href="https://youtu.be/LbkpMAZuOk0">YouTube video</a>. These probably remain the most famous and acclaimed remakes of the OST.
				<ul>
					<li><strong><strong>Craig Hardgrove &ndash; <em>Marathon: Somewhere in the Heavens</em></strong> (<span class="number">2011-07-18</span>)</strong>: The bulk of <em>Eternal</em> <span class="number">1.2</span>&rsquo;s soundtrack.
						<ul>
							<li> <strong><span class="number">2024-01-23</span> remaster</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRsTPy99NcfhHI4ITI?e=Oc6QE9" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a>. Remasters of higher-quality sources of seventeen tracks from <em>Eternal</em> 1.2&rsquo;s soundtrack. Eleven tracks have lossless AIFF sources; I&rsquo;ve upmastered the other six (&ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;, &ldquo;Aliens Again&rdquo;, &ldquo;What About Bob?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;, &ldquo;New Pacific&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Splash (Marathon)&rdquo;), which were lossy M4A. In addition, I&rsquo;ve declipped most tracks to mitigate clipping distortion. These are likely the highest-quality versions of these tracks I’ll be able to make until I&rsquo;m able to re-export the original project files in GarageBand 1.1.0 and 3.0.5 sans clipping; however, a few project files have missing loops, and if we can&rsquo;t locate them, I may be unable to remaster them all perfectly.</li>
							<li><strong>GarageBand source files & original exports</strong>: <a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/music/source/CH_remakes_source.zip">AIFF, M<span class="number">4</span>A, MP<span class="number">3</span>, & .band</a> via <a href="https://www.themarathonmusic.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Craig&rsquo;s website</a></li>

			<li><strong><strong id="ckt1138">CKT<span class="number">1138</span></strong> (<span class="number">2021-03-12</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/7uadHRPqrec" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-ost-2021-3" target="_blank">FLAC & Ogg Vorbis</a>. Faithful reorchestrations using vintage &rsquo;<span class="number">80</span>s and early &rsquo;<span class="number">90</span>s synthesizers, with a sound worthy of Vangelis&rsquo; <em>Blade Runner</em> OST on several tracks.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="matrix_xv">Matrix_XV</strong> (<span class="number">2022-08-28</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1ZSRa3ff5Bw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1017808995219669022/Matrix_XV_Marathon_2021-2022_FLAC.zip" target="_blank">upmastered FLAC</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1017809746281115811/Matrix_XV_Marathon_2021-2022_Vorbis__MP3.zip" target="_blank">Ogg Vorbis/MP<span class="number">3</span></a>. Lush, generally faithful remakes with modern synthesizers, and the points of departure, like the Black Sabbath-inspired take on &lsquo;Landing&rsquo;, are superb.</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="seeyoustarsaide">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>See You Starside: The Marathon Soundtrack Reimagined</em></strong> (<span class="number">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRph-QWQl1PmXFYmsh?e=vJGZN3" target="_blank">FLAC & Ogg Vorbis</a>. My latest complete <em>Marathon</em> OST arrangement album, made from <span class="number">2022-12</span> to <span class="number">2021-01</span> in GarageBand. Also available: my <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpiDJtWC0bGx8yRLG?e=NRght3" target="_blank">first drafts</a> (from <span class="number">2022-12-05</span>), <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpEIECjVvcyQb2Ijw?e=Ozrchn" target="_blank">interim revisions</a>, and <a href="discography.html">complete discography</a>. The <span class="number">2022-12-05</span> tracks are &rsquo;70s/&rsquo;80s-style remixes inspired by <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;used future&rsquo; aesthetic. I&rsquo;d already planned to take creative liberties with the OST&rsquo;s sound when I started, but I took steadily more as I gained familiarity with GarageBand&rsquo;s surprisingly robust feature set; many tracks are heavily expanded to the extent of almost qualifying as complete rewrites (<em>See You Starside</em> adds some thirty-eight minutes to the OST&rsquo;s running time). Roland drum machine and Mellotron samples are ubiquitous in all versions. My biggest influences are &rsquo;70s progressive rock, &rsquo;80s pop, &rsquo;90s Japanese game soundtracks, and &rsquo;90s/&rsquo;00s post-rock; my secondary influences include metal, jazz, blues, classical, disco, ambient, Gregorian chant, electronic music, and film and TV soundtracks.
				<ul>
					<li>You can also listen to <em>See You Starside</em> on <a href="https://youtu.be/bRiDh3PziWU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but if you do, <em>please</em> use an adblocker (e.g., uBlock Origin), as I neither want advertisements on this video nor receive any money from them.</li>
					<li><strong><strong id="violinsagain">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>Violins Again: An Orchestral Marathon Soundtrack</em></strong> (<span class="number">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqEnfSORxEqDkl_UX?e=QHlbjK" target="_blank">FLAC</a>. The above mixes&rsquo; &lsquo;orchestral&rsquo; counterpart (though, as I can&rsquo;t afford to hire an actual orchestra, it&rsquo;s really every bit as synthetic). Most of the melodies are identical, but the instrumentation favours violins, harps, and pianos over guitars or synthesizers (though this is not a universal rule). Occasionally, the orchestra is more eastern (you&rsquo;ll hear a koto on several tracks and a sitar on at least one), or may involve electric violins, viole, celli, or basses; unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the involvement of any electric light orchestras. I don&rsquo;t really like this title, but I never thought of a better one.</li>
					<li><strong><strong id="andbeyond">Aaron Freed &ndash; <em>&hellip;And Beyond: The Marathon Future Symphonic Mixes</em></strong> (<span class="number">2023-02-04</span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqH0LY06-Tz2pxu2A?e=FuoPFu" target="_blank">FLAC</a>. The result of combining <em>See You Starside</em> with <em>Violins Again</em>. Honestly, I don&rsquo;t really like this title either, but again, I never thought of anything better. The subtitle is at least justifiable in that, by the time <em>Marathon</em> takes place, genres like rock, jazz, and even hip-hop and metal will probably be lumped in with Classical music the way we lump Baroque, Romantic, and even Modernist music in with &lsquo;Classical&rsquo;, even though the Classical period was properly only from ca. 1750 to ca. 1820.</li>
					<li><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqjjdDEHCSQbBVC9L?e=N18xZg" target="_blank" id="aaronlogic">WIP revisions</a> of the above sets using Logic Pro and EastWest ComposerCloud+ instruments. I composed and arranged the above sets entirely in GarageBand and, with only four exceptions, used GarageBand or MainStage instruments &ndash; I wanted to show that it needn&rsquo;t cost a fortune to make music that sounds good. (<em>Violins Again</em> and <em>&hellip;And Beyond</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aliens Again&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chomber&rsquo; use ComposerCloud+ instruments. MainStage is an entirely reasonable $50, and GarageBand comes free with every Mac.) I&rsquo;m now revising them with professional-grade software and instrumentation, but note that several tracks currently have significant instrument balance issues; I&rsquo;ll fix these in subsequent revisions.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong><strong id="eternal1.3"><em>(WIP) Eternal X</em> <span class="number">1.3</span> OST</strong> (likely to be released sometime in <span class="number">2024</span>)</strong>: Over seven hours of music by some thirteen contributors, mostly drawing from the <em>Marathon <span class="number">1</span></em> soundtrack. There&rsquo;s some overlap with several of the above composers&rsquo; work, but some of these tracks have been revised, remixed, or remastered for <em>Eternal</em> 1.3, and since they frequently segue seamlessly into one another, you probably won&rsquo;t have heard most of them in these exact configurations before. The OST has been updated and expanded substantially even in recent months, and several of these mixes are unique to <em>Eternal</em> 1.3.<br /><br />
			
			There are two different versions of this soundtrack, which should not be confused as they serve different purposes: 
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Original Soundtrack (OST):</strong> <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRnUJawmCYx8my2zSS?e=ECcjQf" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a> (depending on track). Meant for listening outside the game; the quietest sections are left at their original volume levels, and tracks that loop in-game will loop past the loop point and then fade out. The level music for &ldquo;We Met Once in the Garden&rdquo; (which changes over the course of the level dynamically based on in-game events) is combined into a single track. Filenames contain track numbers and spaces.</li>
					<li><strong>In-game soundtrack:</strong> <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqmPm-N3SlVYZPEj2?e=lhtbHI" target="_blank">FLAC/upmastered FLAC</a> (depending on track). For use in-game with 1.3 preview 6. Tracks that loop in-game will cut off suddenly if played in an audio player, and I made the quietest sections of a few tracks louder so they&rsquo;ll be audible over the game sound effects. The level music for &ldquo;We Met Once in the Garden&rdquo; is split into three tracks. Tracks are grouped into folders, and the filenames are less useful.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Several others (e.g., <strong>wowbobwow</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong>, <strong>dontask4470</strong>, <strong>Zesorath</strong>, & <strong>Myrzir</strong>) have begun but not yet finished what I sincerely hope will be remixes of the entire OST. Search their names on <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY" target="_blank">the Discord</a> and add &lsquo;<strong>has: sound</strong>&rsquo; to find them.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<h2 id="m2se"><em>Marathon <span class="number">2</span> Special Edition</em> OST</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1016822130735849502/M2_Special_Edition_Tracks.zip" target="_blank">Upmastered FLAC</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669769856974979093/1050609727551312023/Tracks.zip" target="_blank">MP<span class="number">3</span></a>. If you follow the instructions below, the MP3 version will work with both the original Mac and the Windows 95 versions of the <em>Marathon <span class="number">2</span></em> map in any recent version of Aleph One. Aleph One 1.6.1 is the earliest release that can play FLAC.</p>

		<p>Solo Lua scripts. <strong><em>Prior to Aleph One <span class="number">1</span>.<span class="number">6</span>.<span class="number">1</span>, these <strong>only</strong> work with the MP<span class="number" style="font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;">3</span> version.</em></strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1076398276137455667/SpecialEditionMusic_original.lua">Unaltered M2SE tracklist</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1076398276431061022/SpecialEditionMusic_revised.lua">Revised tracklist</a>: <em>Reassigns the music on the following three levels, but is otherwise identical:</em>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>&lsquo;God Will Sort the Dead&rsquo;</strong>: the revised tracklist swaps out &lsquo;Momar&rsquo;, which the <em>M<span class="number">2</span>SE</em> also uses on &lsquo;Charon Doesn&rsquo;t Make Change&rsquo;, for &lsquo;This Means War&rsquo;, which the <em>M<span class="number">2</span>SE</em> doesn&rsquo;t use in any solo levels.</li>
					<li><strong>&lsquo;The Big House&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;Beware of Abandoned Rental Trucks&rsquo;</strong>: the <em>M<span class="number">2</span>SE</em> used the <span class="number">90</span>-second &lsquo;Hopper&rsquo; on the former (which was greatly expanded and called &lsquo;The Big House Special&rsquo; in the <em>M<span class="number">2</span>SE</em>) and the <span class="number">42</span>-second &lsquo;Dreamscape&rsquo; on the latter. The revised tracklist swaps these.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Select either of these and use them as a solo Lua script. Make sure you&rsquo;ve got the MP3 (or, in 1.6.1 or later, FLAC) files in a <strong>Tracks</strong> folder inside your <strong>Marathon <span class="number">2</span></strong> folder, that you don&rsquo;t have any other solo Lua running, and that &lsquo;Music Volume&rsquo; in your sound settings is set to an audible level. So, if your <em>Marathon <span class="number">2</span></em> folder is:</p> 

			<blockquote><pre>F:\Games\Marathon 2</pre></blockquote>

		<p>Then the path to &lsquo;Alien Voyage.mp3&rsquo; should be:</p>

			<blockquote><pre>F:\Games\Marathon 2\Tracks\Alien Voyage.mp3</pre></blockquote>

		<p>Other paths will not work.</p>

		<p>The <em>Marathon <span class="number">2</span> Special Edition</em> itself is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701021658fw_/http:/orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/scenario/Marathon 2 Special Edition.zip">here</a>.

		<h2 id="remasterinfo" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Remaster Info</h2>
		<h4 style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 0px;">Adapted from <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2&rsquo;s OST liner notes, with edits for clarity,<br />
		brevity, &amp; insights from five subsequent years of working with sound</h4>

		<p>My first step for around 75% of these was declipping. Many people seem to pay little attention to the levels when mixing and/or mastering songs; as a result, the peaks and troughs of waveforms get clipped off (it&rsquo;s essentially the result of a variable overflow), creating a form of distortion informally referred to as &lsquo;black noise&rsquo;. It results in a muffled sound and can cause listener fatigue. (If you want to find yourself annoyed at 90% of modern music, look up the loudness war.)</p>

		<p>Thus, I employed iZotope&rsquo;s declipper for any song that clipped. I must emphasize that the declipper <em>cannot</em> perfectly reconstruct the data lost from clipping, but it usually comes up with reasonable approximations that will suffice for most people&rsquo;s listening. The declipper scans the waveform and tells you where it clips. You can usually set the filter to start at 0.25 or 0.5 dB below that and get good results.</p>

		<p>(I&rsquo;d usually recommend running this process on an entire album at once to avoid messing up gapless transitions and preserve its songs&rsquo; relative volumes, which can have artistic reasoning behind them. However, here, I could reasonably infer that they didn&rsquo;t, so I did this process song-by-song. Additionally, on some albums, some songs may clip at different levels; for that matter, different segments of individual songs may also clip at different levels. <em>Listen</em>, and use your best judgement.)</p>

		<p>Next, I ran most songs 90&deg; through a phase rotation filter; this mostly affects subsonic (&leq;20 Hz) frequencies, but also usually increases dynamic range. I have no hypothesis for why this reduces listener fatigue; it shouldn&rsquo;t be perceptibly different at all. However, this is the only palatable way I&rsquo;ve found to listen to various albums that are too distorted to salvage with declipping (i.e., <span class="dotted" id="note4ref" title="I wouldn&rsquo;t even think to mess with Merzbow&rsquo;s work when listening to it on speakers, but this is the only way I know of to listen to those albums on headphones without risking deafness. They are, to my knowledge, the two loudest albums ever pressed to CD.">Merzbow&rsquo;s <em>Venereology</em> and <em>Pulse Demon</em><a href="note5">&#8317;<span class="number">&#8309;</span>&#8318;</a></span>; the Psychic Paramount&rsquo;s <em>Gamelan into the Mink Supernatural</em>). Since it performed wonders for those recordings, it&rsquo;s now a standard part of my remastering process.</p>

		<blockquote>[<strong>Warning:</strong> You should generally only use phase rotation on a finished mix, unless there are phase issues with a recording you&rsquo;re mixing; phase rotation can be destructive. In the most extreme case, phase rotating a recording by </em><span class="number">180</span>&deg; and mix pasting it with its original produces silence!]</blockquote>

		<p>Those two steps, along with normalising to -0.1 dB, should suffice for any recording for which you have a lossless source. Unfortunately, this was the case for none of the <em>Eternal</em> tracks; they were all MP3s. Craig Hardgrove and Nicholas Singer didn&rsquo;t have higher-quality versions of their recordings; Dr Hardgrove said he might someday be able to make lossless versions, but it didn&rsquo;t sound like it&rsquo;d be anytime soon. Thus, I approximated the missing upper frequencies as well. (I was unable to contact Thomas Livingston or Eike Steffen at all.)</p>

		<p>In each case, I copied my results to a new file. Then I ran the &lsquo;pitch & time&rsquo; filter to raise the pitch by 12 half-steps, or an octave, using the highest possible quality algorithm, Radius. This is a time-consuming, processor-intensive task that may take several times a song or album&rsquo;s running time on many machines. Feel free to step away to get a drink or something while it runs.</p>

		<p>Once it finishes, roll off the lower frequencies of your pitch-raised copy with the Corrective EQ filter. You&rsquo;ll want to discard everything below about 14 kHz, depending upon the quality of MP3 compression. I used the analogue filter &lsquo;low shelf&rsquo; for most of the bands, but the exact slope and gain I used depended on the track. Lastly, mix paste the results with your original track. You may have to experiment with several different EQ settings to find the best-sounding version; unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution here, and simply eyeballing the results won&rsquo;t suffice. Use your best judgement. Once you&rsquo;re satisfied, normalise to -0.1 dB, export as FLAC, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

		<blockquote>[Note: Modern versions of iZotope call this filter simply &lsquo;EQ&rsquo;, and rather than using the low shelf, you can just use a high pass filter with it. I&rsquo;ve also taken to adding a much subtler low pass filter as well.]</blockquote>

		<p>This process may be able to salvage many modern recordings that you may otherwise find fatiguing. To be honest, I find myself putting about 90% of the music I download these days through at least some of these steps, but I admit to being obsessive about this sort of thing. Regardless, I hope some readers find it useful for some of the worst offenders.</p>

		<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

		<p>This pitch-shifting method works much better for some instruments than for others. Essentially, if an instrument is primarily based on even harmonics (meaning that if you a play a 440 Hz note, it will have resonant frequencies at 880 Hz, 1,760 Hz, 3,520 Hz, 7,040 Hz, 14,080 Hz, etc.), it will work almost flawlessly; if it is primarily based on odd harmonics, it won&rsquo;t work nearly as well, though many listeners still probably won&rsquo;t be able to notice since the above process results in most frequencies below 16 kHz being rolled off.</p>

		<p>As it so happens, nearly every instrument prominent in rock music &ndash; drums, bass, guitar, organ, and piano &ndash; has fairly substantial even harmonics. This is less reliable for jazz and classical instruments &ndash; closed-end wind instruments tend to be based almost entirely on odd harmonics, so a clarinet will have almost no resonant frequencies an octave apart, while a trumpet will only have some. Synthesizers are a complete mixed bag; some synth voices have no even harmonics at all, while others have plenty. <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/harmonics-and-musical-instruments.1057484/">This Steve Hoffman Forums thread</a> may be enlightening on this count.</p>
