		<h1>Remixes & Fan Soundtracks for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (1994)</h1>

		<p>This is a list of (mostly) completed soundtracks for Bungie&rsquo;s <em>Marathon</em> (1994) and its sequels, plus fan games for Aleph One, the open-source continuation of the <em>Marathon</em> engine. With the exception of <em>Eternal X</em> 1.3&rsquo;s monster work-in-progress soundtrack, I&rsquo;ve attempted to keep this predominantly to completed projects. (I&rsquo;m still revising my 2022 remixes, but all sixteen tracks from the OST are already available; conversely, some twenty years later, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say Tobacco or Cannibal Whore Feast are each highly unlikely to do additional remixes, and you do get all sixteen tracks of the OST between them.)</p>

		<p>A quick note on file formats: FLAC is for listening outside the game, and MP3 or Ogg Vorbis for use within it (since Aleph One currently doesn&rsquo;t play FLAC). &lsquo;Pseudo-FLAC&rsquo; means I didn&rsquo;t have a lossless source, so I made a facsimile. I explained my process in a document included with the <em>Eternal</em> 1.2 OST, which I&rsquo;ve reproduced below with further elaboration on some specifics of the process.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve endeavoured to list release dates as accurately as possible. All dates are ISO format (<strong>yyyy-mm-dd</strong>) where I possess information that specific; a few dates for which I have less specific information are listed as <strong>yyyy-mm</strong> or simply <strong>yyyy</strong>.</p>

		<h2 id="m1"><em>Marathon 1</em> Remixes</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Craig Hardgrove&rsquo;s site</a> has a massive number of these. Except as noted, the following <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> on his site, and unless otherwise noted, they all contain at least one remix of every track in <em>Marathon 1</em>&rsquo;s OST:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><strong>QuickTime 2.0/2.5 stereo</strong></strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/dcWHHYsoNk8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://dropbox.com/sh/2ph95u9cvid5c5s/AACsQ0IVzHPsCxAT_B-xRkoda?dl=1">FLAC</a>. QuickTime 2.0 in the left channel, QuickTime 2.5 in the right</li>
			<li><strong><strong>My QuickTime 2.5 remixes</strong> (1997)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/qVecMMHALOI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hwjjj5jew565fd/Aaron Freed - Marathon Remixes.rar?dl=1">FLAC</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8sxqhekhmknac2/Aaron Freed - Marathon Remixes %28ogg%29.zip?dl=1">Ogg Vorbis</a>. Extremely faithful to the original sound, adding only stereo, reverb, and a few other flourishes</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Tobacco</strong> (2001-07-24):</strong> <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggsZwUnGHpiNhFQp?e=zLoLw2" target="_blank">pseudo-FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks: 
				<ol style="margin-top: 4px;">
					<li>Chomber</li>
					<li>Fat Man</li>
					<li>Flowers in Heaven</li>
					<li>Landing</li>
					<li>Leela</li>
					<li>Rushing</li>
					<li>Splash (Marathon)</li>
					<li>Swirls</li>
				</ol>
			Wonderful remakes that add some tasteful – and tasty – new instrumental parts.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Chibi-usa</strong> (2002-03-11)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRgzV_SUjc5srN7I2z?e=hC36Kn" target="_blank">pseudo-FLAC</a>. Tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Cannibal Whore Feast</strong> (2003-08-12)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggq6dI494c5fnmyq?e=JUvMXd" target="_blank">pseudo-FLAC</a>. Contains the following eight tracks:
				<ol style="margin-top: 4px;">
					<li>Aliens Again</li>
					<li>Flippant</li>
					<li>Freedom</li>
					<li>Guardians</li>
					<li>New Pacific</li>
					<li>New Pacific (reprise)</li>
					<li>Rapture</li>
					<li>What About Bob?</li>
				</ol>
			Like Chibi-usa&rsquo;s, these are tasteful reorchestrations with a higher-quality synthesizer. And you can combine these with Tobacco&rsquo;s for another complete set of remixes.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Will Christian</strong> (2016-10-17)</strong>: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/will-christian-2/albums" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1018917922938306670/Will_Christian_-_2016_-_Marathon_1_Soundtrack_Modern_Remaster.zip" target="_blank">FLAC</a>. Some interesting, inventive takes. I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought to rearrange &lsquo;Leela&rsquo; as a metal track, but&hellip; somehow, it works.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Talashar</strong> (2018-11-18)</strong>: <a href="http://talashar.bandcamp.com/album/eupfhoria" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> (streaming, FLAC, nearly any other format you want). Atmospheric reorchestrations that add new layers of harmony and melody, resulting in some fantastic twists on old classics.</li>
			<li><strong><strong><em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 OST</strong> (<span id="note1ref" class="dotted" title="While Eternal X 1.2.0 was not released until 2019-03-28, its OST was first released on 2018-12-21 to commemorate Marathon&rsquo;s 24th anniversary.">2018-12-21<a href="#note1">&#8317;&sup1;&#8318;</a></span>)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRggmThH4ilUengJ2J" target="_blank">pseudo-FLAC</a>. Craig&rsquo;s site has the <a href="http://www.themarathonmusic.com/music/eternal_remastered/Marathon_Eternal_OST_Remastered.zip">Ogg Vorbis files</a> (but if you have <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2 or 1.2.1, you already have most of these anyway) and a link to the <a href="https://youtu.be/LbkpMAZuOk0">YouTube video</a>. These probably remain the most famous and acclaimed remakes of the OST.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>CKT1138</strong> (2021-03-12)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/7uadHRPqrec" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://simplici7y.com/items/marathon-ost-2021-3" target="_blank">FLAC & Ogg Vorbis</a>. Faithful reorchestrations using vintage &rsquo;80s and early &rsquo;90s synthesizers, with a sound worthy of Vangelis&rsquo; <em>Blade Runner</em> OST on several tracks.</li>
			<li><strong><strong>Matrix_XV</strong> (2022-08-28)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1ZSRa3ff5Bw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1017808995219669022/Matrix_XV_Marathon_2021-2022_FLAC.zip" target="_blank">pseudo-FLAC</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1017809746281115811/Matrix_XV_Marathon_2021-2022_Vorbis__MP3.zip" target="_blank">Ogg Vorbis/MP3</a>. Lush, generally faithful remakes with modern synthesizers, and the points of departure, like the Black Sabbath-inspired take on &lsquo;Landing&rsquo;, are inspired.</li>
			<li><strong><strong><em>(WIP)</em> My GarageBand remixes</strong> (ongoing since 2022-12-05)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpA90wfRcJhmDmMSR?e=BnSJGH">FLAC</a>. &rsquo;70s/&rsquo;80s-style remixes inspired by <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;used future&rsquo; aesthetic that take more creative liberties with the OST&rsquo;s sound; still undergoing major revisions, but all sixteen tracks are already present. Roland drum machine and Mellotron samples are ubiquitous.</li>
			<li><strong><strong><em>(WIP) Eternal X</em> 1.3 OST</strong> (likely to be released sometime in 2023)</strong>: <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRnUJawmCYx8my2zSS?e=ECcjQf" target="_blank">FLAC/pseudo-FLAC</a> (depending on track). More than five hours of music by eleven contributors, mostly drawing from the <em>Marathon 1</em> soundtrack. There is some overlap with several of the above composers&rsquo; work, but since the tracks frequently segue seamlessly into one another, you probably won&rsquo;t have heard most of these tracks in these exact configurations before (unless you&rsquo;ve already played one of the recent <em>Eternal</em> 1.3 previews, of course).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Several others (i.e., <strong>wowbobwow</strong>, <strong>Storm</strong>, & <strong>dontask4470</strong>) have begun but not yet finished what I sincerely hope will be remixes of the entire OST. Search their names on <a href="https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY" target="_blank">the Discord</a> and add &lsquo;has: sound&rsquo; to bring them up.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<h2 id="m2se"><em>Marathon 2 Special Edition</em> OST</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1016822130735849502/M2_Special_Edition_Tracks.zip" target="_blank">Pseudo-FLAC</a>, <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411728467978223617/1017202391638089822/M2_Special_Edition_Tracks_MP3_V0.zip" target="_blank">MP3</a>. If you follow the instructions below, the MP3 version will work with both the original Mac and the Windows 95 versions of the <em>Marathon 2</em> map. (Aleph One does not play FLAC.)</p>

		<p>Solo Lua scripts for use <strong><em>with the MP3 version only:</em></strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669769856974979093/1027784338626052136/SpecialEditionMusic_original.lua">Unaltered M2SE tracklist</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/669769856974979093/1027784338974187530/SpecialEditionMusic_revised.lua">Revised tracklist</a>: <em>Reassigns the music on the following three levels, but is otherwise identical:</em>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>&lsquo;God Will Sort the Dead&rsquo;</strong>: the revised tracklist swaps out &lsquo;Momar&rsquo;, which the <em>M2SE</em> also uses on &lsquo;Charon Doesn&rsquo;t Make Change&rsquo;, for &lsquo;This Means War&rsquo;, which the <em>M2SE</em> doesn&rsquo;t use in any solo levels.</li>
					<li><strong>&lsquo;The Big House&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;Beware of Abandoned Rental Trucks&rsquo;</strong>: the <em>M2SE</em> used the 90-second &lsquo;Hopper&rsquo; on the former (which was greatly expanded and called &lsquo;The Big House Special&rsquo; in the <em>M2SE</em>) and the 42-second &lsquo;Dreamscape&rsquo; on the latter. The revised tracklist swaps these.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Select either of these and use them as a solo Lua script. Make sure you&rsquo;ve got the MP3 files in a <strong>Tracks</strong> folder inside your <strong>Marathon 2</strong> folder, that you don&rsquo;t have any other solo Lua running, and that your music volume is something audible. So, if your <em>Marathon 2</em> folder is:</p> 

			<blockquote><pre>F:\Games\Marathon 2</pre></blockquote>

		<p>Then the path to &lsquo;Alien Voyage.mp3&rsquo; should be:</p>

			<blockquote><pre>F:\Games\Marathon 2\Tracks\Alien Voyage.mp3</pre></blockquote>

		<p>Other paths will not work.</p>

		<p>The <em>Marathon 2 Special Edition</em> itself is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070701021658fw_/http:/orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/scenario/Marathon 2 Special Edition.zip">here</a>.

		<h2 id="remasterinfo" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Remaster Info</h2>
		<h4 style="font-size: 13px; margin-top: 0px;">Reproduced from <em>Eternal X</em> 1.2&rsquo;s OST</h4>

		<p>My first step for around 75% of these was declipping. Many people seem to pay little attention to the levels when they mix and/or master songs, and as a result, the peaks and troughs of waveforms get clipped off (it&rsquo;s essentially the result of a variable overflow), creating a form of distortion informally referred to as &lsquo;black noise&rsquo;. It results in a muffled sound and can cause listener fatigue. (If you want to find yourself annoyed at 90% of modern music, you can look up the loudness war.)</p>

		<p>Thus, I employed iZotope&rsquo;s declipper for any song that clipped. I must repeat that the declipper <em>cannot</em> perfectly reconstruct the data lost from clipping, but it usually comes up with reasonable approximations that will suffice for most people&rsquo;s listening. The declipper scans the waveform and tells you where it clips. You can usually set the filter to start at 0.25 or 0.5 dB below that and get good results.</p>

		<p>(I should note that in many cases, I recommend running this process an entire album at once so that you don&rsquo;t wind up losing the relative levels of each song; there may be artistic reasons for the differences. However, in this case, I could reasonably infer that there wasn&rsquo;t, so I did this process song-bysong. Additionally, note that on some albums, some songs may clip at different levels; for that matter, different segments of individual songs may also clip at different levels. Use your best judgement.)</p>

		<p>Next, I ran most songs 90&deg; through a phase rotation filter. This filter mostly affects subsonic (&leq;20 Hz) frequencies, but also usually results in higher dynamic range. I don&rsquo;t have a hypothesis for why this reduces listener fatigue; it shouldn&rsquo;t be perceptibly different at all. However, this is the only palatable way I&rsquo;ve found to listen to various albums that are too distorted to salvage with declipping (i.e., <span class="dotted" id="note4ref" title="I wouldn&rsquo;t even think to mess with Merzbow&rsquo;s work when listening to it on speakers, but this is the only way I know of to listen to those albums on headphones without risking deafness. They are, to my knowledge, the two loudest albums ever pressed to CD.">Merzbow&rsquo;s <em>Venereology</em> and <em>Pulse Demon</em><a href="note4">&#8317;&#8308;&#8318;</a></span>; the Psychic Paramount&rsquo;s <em>Gamelan into the Mink Supernatural</em>). Since it performed wonders for those recordings, it&rsquo;s now a standard part of my remastering process.</p>

		<p>Those two steps, along with normalising to -0.1 dB, should suffice for any recording for which you have a lossless source. Unfortunately, this was the case for none of the <em>Eternal</em> tracks; they were all MP3 files. Dr Hardgrove didn&rsquo;t have higher-quality versions of his recordings; he said he might someday be able to make lossless versions, but it didn&rsquo;t sound like it would be anytime soon. Thus, I approximated the missing upper frequencies as well. (I was unable to contact <span class="dotted" id="note5ref" title="At the time, at least. I&rsquo;ve since heard back from him, but he didn&rsquo;t have lossless sources for the audio.">Nick<a href="note5">&#8317;&#8309;&#8318;</a></span>, Tommy, or Eike at all.)</p>

		<p>In each case, I copied my results to a new file. Then I ran the &ldquo;pitch & time&rdquo; filter to raise the pitch by 12 half-steps, or an octave, using the highest possible quality algorithm (I think it&rsquo;s called Radius). This is a time-consuming, processor-intensive task that may take several times a song or album&rsquo;s running time on many machines. Feel free to step away to get a drink or something while it runs.</p>

		<p>Once it finishes, roll off the lower frequencies of your pitch-raised copy with the corrective EQ filter. You&rsquo;ll want to discard everything below about 14 kHz, depending upon the quality of MP3 compression. I used the analogue filter &ldquo;low shelf&rdquo; for most of the bands, but the exact slope and gain I used depended on the track. Lastly, mix paste the results with your original track, normalise to -0.1 dB, export as FLAC, and you&rsquo;re done. <em>[Note: In modern versions of iZotope, this filter is simply called &lsquo;EQ&rsquo;, and you can just use a high pass filter with it. I&rsquo;ve also taken to adding a much more subtle low pass filter as well.]</em></p>

		<p>This process may be able to salvage many modern recordings that you may otherwise find fatiguing. To be honest, I find myself putting about 90% of the music I download these days through at least some of these steps, but I admit to being obsessive about this sort of thing. Regardless, I hope some readers find it useful for some of the worst offenders.</p>

		<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

		<p>This pitch-shifting method works much better for some instruments than for others. Essentially, if an instrument is primarily based on even harmonics (meaning that if you a play a 440 Hz note, it will have resonant frequencies at 880 Hz, 1,760 Hz, 3,520 Hz, 7,040 Hz, 14,080 Hz, etc.), it will work almost flawlessly; if it is primarily based on odd harmonics, it won&rsquo;t work nearly as well, though many listeners still probably won&rsquo;t be able to notice since the above process results in most frequencies below 16 kHz being rolled off.</p>

		<p>As it so happens, nearly every instrument prominent in rock music &ndash; drums, bass, guitar, organ, and piano &ndash; has fairly substantial even harmonics. This is less reliable for jazz and classical instruments &ndash; closed-end wind instruments tend to be based almost entirely on odd harmonics, so a clarinet will have almost no resonant frequencies an octave apart, while a trumpet will only have some. Synthesizers are a complete mixed bag; some synth voices have no even harmonics at all, while others have plenty. <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/harmonics-and-musical-instruments.1057484/">This Steve Hoffman Forums thread</a> may be enlightening on this count.</p>
