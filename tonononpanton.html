			<p>The historical irony is that the Ancient Greek Cynics were, despite the term’s modern usage, actually some of the most idealistic people in history – indeed, many gave away all their possessions, placing them about as far from Wilde’s quote as humanly possible. Translating it into Attic Greek therefore amused me.</p>

			<p>(Note on quotations: I consistently use <span class="toc-counter">«guillemets»</span> both for Greek quotations (as do Greeks themselves) and for romanizations thereof. For Chinese and Japanese, I use both languages’ standard <span class="toc-counter">「corner brackets」</span>, and <span class="toc-counter">｢half-width corner brackets｣</span> for romanizations thereof.)</p>

						<p>A very early work in progress meant as a loose style pastiche of the <span class="artistcredit">Nightwish</span> track it’s named after. It doesn’t actually feel very close yet, which isn’t all that surprising, since <span class="artistcredit">Tuomas Holopainen</span>’s composition style is deceptively complex. I’m not entirely certain where this one is going yet, or if I’ll even attempt to finish it in this style – I may end up taking it in a completely different direction.</p>
						
						<p class="weight4thickness hyphenate">Even if I don’t, it already sounds like it belongs in a ’90s JRPG, so I’ll probably lean into the <span class="artistcredit">No&shy;bu&shy;o U&shy;e&shy;mat&shy;su</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Ya&shy;su&shy;no&shy;ri Mit&shy;su&shy;da</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Hi&shy;ro&shy;ki Ki&shy;ku&shy;ta</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Yo&shy;ko Shi&shy;mo&shy;mu&shy;ra</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Mo&shy;to&shy;i Sa&shy;ku&shy;ra&shy;ba</span> style as much as I can. I’ve been listening to all five for over two decades; the first three in particular are such fundamental influences on me that I doubt I could write something without their influence if I tried. <span id="ftnt_ref02" class="toc-counter dotted" title="“Freewill” and “La Villa Strangiato” are Exhibits A & B in my case that Alex Lifeson is the most underrated guitarist in any band that well-known, just ahead of Adam Jones (Tool), Todd Rundgren (solo/Utopia), Andy Summers (the Police), and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac). (Prince and the Smiths’ Johnny Marr also used to be on this list until people started to give them their roses.) ¶ And this should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: R.I.P. Neil Peart, the greatest to ever do it."><a href="https://youtu.be/urBpdyFCZmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="noprintlink">In the immortal words of a great Canadian philosopher</a>:<span class="linktext"> &#10216;youtu<wbr />.be<wbr />/urBpdyFCZmo&#10217;</span> “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.<a href="#ftnt02" class="normal">&#8317;²&#8318;</a>”</span></span> A corollary of this principle is that if you try <em>not</em> to sound like an act, they have still influenced you.</p>

						<p>There’s probably also some conspicuous <span class="artistcredit">Genesis</span> influence on this – another fundamental influence on my songwriting that I doubt I could dispel if I tried (I’ve probably been listening to them since my literal infancy). I can’t think of a popular music composer <em>more</em> skilled at key modulation than <span class="artistcredit">Tony Banks</span>, and perhaps only <span class="artistcredit">Brian Wilson</span> is on his level.</p>
						
						<p>I avoided modulation when writing music for <em class="albumcredit">Tempus Irae Redux</em>, which often featured a chant drone on C as an ambient sound; thus, modulations could introduce unintended dissonance. I also haven’t used them in my <em class="albumcredit">Endless Sky</em> tracks: they’re meant to be built on-the-fly based on game conditions, requiring everything to be in the same key for optimal results (I’ve settled on G minor). As a result, actually being able to change keys in a new composition for once has felt oddly liberating.</p>
						
						<p>Naturally, this changes key a few times; I think I employed some variant of <span class="artistcredit">John Coltrane</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Giant Steps</strong>”</span> progression. Just don’t ask me to improvise over it.</p>

						<p>This song uses some deliberately eerie and even dissonant chord progressions, and I pretty quickly settled on effectively making the evil twin of <span class="artistcredit">Genesis</span>’ <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Watcher of the Skies</strong>”</span>, just with added disco influence (despite the song also being in <span class="fraction">7/4</span>). The idea is to make it both as evil-sounding and as funky as possible.</p>

						The title is a segment of an apocryphal Chinese curse translated into Traditional Chinese. This track will have three movements, all titled after apocryphal Chinese curses that I’ve translated to Traditional Chinese:

						<p>The late, dearly lamented <span class="artistcredit">Sir Terry Pratchett</span> had this to say:</p>

							<blockquote class="toc-counter">“The phrase ‘may you live in interesting times’ is the lowest in a trilogy of Chinese curses that continue ‘may you come to the attention of those in authority’ and finish with ‘may the gods give you everything you ask for.’ I have no idea about its authenticity.”</blockquote>

						<p>They are, to repeat myself, apocryphal. I can’t really claim to read either Traditional or Simplified Chinese, nor to speak any of the Chinese languages, but I find it rather fitting for a Westerner’s translations of apocryphal Chinese curses to possess what I’m sure is the awkward syntax I’ve imbued them with, so I don’t think that’s actually a problem. If my versions sound like a case of <span class="toc-counter">“<span id="ftnt_ref03" class="dotted" title="“Foreigner”, “outsider”, “stranger”, or “non-family member”. More importantly, it uses the same characters (「外人」) and is descended from the same Middle Chinese word as the Japanese word ｢gaijin｣, though it seems to lack the latter’s derogatory connotations."><em>wa&#768;ire&#769;n</em><a href="#ftnt03" class="normal">&#8317;³&#8318;</a></span> trying (unsuccessfully) to make a Western fabrication sound authentically Chinese,”</span> that seems genuinely apropos.</p>

						<p>In any case, an identical translation of <span class="toc-counter">“May you live in interesting times”</span> to mine appears on dozens of Chinese-language websites, so I’m sure that’s correct, but I can’t find the other two, so it’s possible that no one took the liberty of translating <span class="artist">Pratchett</span>’s curses to Chinese before I did, which strikes me as a shame.</p>
						
						<p>(I originally simplified the second curse to <span class="toc-counter" lang="zh">「願當局注意你」</span> [<em class="toc-counter">｢Yua&#768;n da&#772;ngju&#769; zhu&#768;yi&#768; ni&#780;｣</em>, <span class="toc-counter">“May the authorities take notice of you”</span>] because I very definitely didn’t feel I understood Chinese grammar well enough to do his full version justice, but I’ve come around to thinking that an awkward translation would fit better, and I like the idea of all three movement titles being equally long.)</p>

						<p id="chineselanguages">To clarify some why I referred to “Chinese <em>languages</em>” in the plural: Written Chinese is one language, or at most two languages (Traditional and Simplified); it essentially represents Classical Chinese, which is no more spoken today than Latin (<span id="ftnt_ref04" class="dotted" title="“even though I myself speak Latin… somewhat.”"><em>tamenetsi&#772; egomet lati&#772;ne&#772; loquor… aliquantum</em><a href="#ftnt04" class="normal">&#8317;⁴&#8318;</a></span>). <em>Spoken</em> Chinese, by contrast, <em>isn’t</em> a single language; it’s a language <em>family</em>. By far the majority of Chinese speakers (a cool 1.2 billion) speak Standard Mandarin. Runners-up Southern Min, Shanghainese, and Cantonese have an order of magnitude fewer speakers than Standard Mandarin – which still means more speakers than all but about two dozen other languages, and more <em>native</em> speakers than all but about a dozen others.</p>

						<p>(Southern Min and Shanghainese are each estimated to have slightly more speakers than Cantonese, but good luck finding any classes in anything other than Standard Mandarin or Cantonese outside China. Also, Standard Mandarin has more than twice as many native speakers [990 million] than the runner-up, Spanish [484 million], but when we count non-native speakers, English actually emerges as the world’s most widely spoken language, with over 1.5 billion total speakers; Mandarin has slightly under 1.2 billion.)</p>

						<p>My hot take is that spoken Chinese is only considered a single language for political reasons: namely, that China’s government insists on it. (It doesn’t help that <span class="toc-counter">「方言」</span>、 <em class="toc-counter">｢fa&#772;ngya&#769;n｣</em>, the Chinese word most often translated <span class="toc-counter">“dialect”</span>, isn’t actually a precise match for that word, so this may be a case of an imprecise translation directly causing a semantic argument.) Standard Mandarin and Cantonese are no more the same language than Italian and Spanish – maybe even less so, as Italian and Spanish are somewhat mutually intelligible. Chinese is sometimes called a macrolanguage, but that seems wrong to me, since many spoken Chinese <em>fa&#772;ngya&#769;n</em> are mutually unintelligible. Chinese linguists themselves often classify Chinese as a language family, following <span class="artistcredit">Fu Maoji</span>’s formulation in the <em class="albumcredit">Encyclopedia of China</em>, and that seems as accurate a classification as one could ask for.</p>

						<p>One interesting fact I learned researching the above: Modern Standard Arabic has no native speakers. All Arabic speakers learn their local dialects at home and Modern Standard Arabic in school. (Imagine speakers of Romance languages learning their native languages at home and New Latin in school and you’ll be in the same ballpark.) Egyptian Arabic is the Arabic dialect with the most native speakers.</p>

						<p class="interpolation"><span class="subheading"><span class="nomobile">Dedicated to</span><span class="mobileonly">For</span> <span class="artistcredit">Ozzy Osbourne</span> (1948-2025)</span></p>

						<p>Loosely inspired by <span class="artistcredit">Black Sabbath</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>War Pigs</strong>”</span> (composed by <span class="artistcredit">Geezer Butler</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Tony Iommi</span>, <span class="artist">Osbourne</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Bill Ward</span>) and <span class="artistcredit">T-Pain</span>’s live cover thereof (performed by <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Curt Chambers</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Rodney Jones Jr.</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Clemons Poindexter</span>, & <span class="artistcredit">Joe Flip Wilson</span>).</p>

						<p>I need to stress that I’m not being facetious here: no less a source than <span class="artist">Osbourne</span> himself declared <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s version <span class="toc-counter">“the greatest <span class="songcredit">‘<strong>War Pigs</strong>’</span> cover ever”</span>. (<span class="artist">Butler</span> likewise called it <span class="toc-counter">“excellent”</span>.) <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s vocals are absolutely killer, and he and his band clearly <em>get</em> not just <span class="artist">Black Sabbath</span> but hard rock and heavy metal as a whole on a fundamental level, throwing in a guitar lick from <span class="artistcredit">Jeff Beck</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Beck’s Bolero</strong>”</span> here, a vocal tic from <span class="artistcredit">Disturbed</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Down with the Sickness</strong>”</span> there. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone do a better job covering <span class="artist">Geezer Butler</span> and <span class="artist">Bill Ward</span> than <span class="artist">Jones</span> and <span class="artist">Poindexter</span> do on the live recording, and <span class="artist">Chambers</span> demonstrates combined degrees of technicality, showmanship, and emotional intensity I’d only previously seen <span id="ftnt_ref05" class="dotted" title="I’ve seen electric guitarists match or exceed them in up to two of those categories: e.g., Eddie Van Halen had the technicality and showmanship, but not the emotional intensity; Gary Moore exceeded them in technicality and perhaps even emotional intensity, but not showmanship. (Moore’s technicality and emotional intensity may be the best I’ve ever heard: imagine Carlos Santana with Van Halen’s ability to shred and you won’t be far off.) ¶ Acoustic guitar is basically a completely different instrument, but a few acoustic players I’ve heard may match them for all three: definitely Marcin Patrzalek, perhaps also Tommy Emmanuel and Lucas Imbiriba. (Imbiriba deserves further props for another seemingly impossible feat: pulling off a faithful vocal cover of Chris Cornell without face-planting. I’ve only heard other people pull off Cornell covers in completely different styles – e.g., Haley Reinhart & Postmodern Jukebox’s “Black Hole Sun”. And Imbiriba does it while playing insanely complex parts.)">from <span class="artistcredit">Jimi Hendrix</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Prince</span>, and had grown afraid no electric guitarist would ever show again.<a href="#ftnt05" class="normal">&#8317;⁵&#8318;</a></span></p>

						<p>But my favorite part is the arrangement: in particular, the reharmonization of the song’s final verse may well be my favorite moment of any cover ever. That’s partly because it’s a <em>beautiful</em> chord progression; it also just <em>fits</em> so well that I almost wish the song had been written like that in the first place. Lyrically, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>War Pigs</strong>”</span> is an explicitly religious sermon against war that ends with warmongers being condemned to hell at Judgement Day, so bumping the gospel music influence up to eleven for that stanza was truly inspired.</p>

						<p>This track uses a chord progression similar, but not quite identical, to their reharmonization. Of course, I rarely write songs with only one set of chord changes, so inevitably, I wander out into left field from there.</p>

						<p>This track’s shuffle rhythm is also no accident. It’s partly inspired by <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s cover, but just as heavily inspired by <span class="artist">Sabbath</span> themselves. All the major early hard rock and metal drummers were heavily inspired by jazz; <span class="artist">Bill Ward</span> grew up listening to big band music and cited <span class="artistcredit">Gene Krupa</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Buddy Rich</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Louie Bellson</span> as his earliest influences. The swing in <span class="artist">Sabbath</span>’s playing is hard to overstate and often overlooked.</p>

						<p>This isn’t just true of <span class="artist">Ward</span>; for instance, <span class="artistcredit">Led Zeppelin</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">John Bonham</span> cited <span class="artist">Krupa</span>, <span class="artist">Rich</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Max Roach</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Joe Morello</span> as influences. This is obvious in his playing; the isolated drums of <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Stairway to Heaven</strong>”</span> are so heavily syncopated that, in another context, they could be the foundation of a club banger. <span class="artist">Krupa</span>’s influence extends beyond <span class="artist">Ward</span> and <span class="artist">Bonham</span> to <span class="artistcredit">Deep Purple</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Ian Paice</span> and <span class="artistcredit">the Who</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Keith Moon</span>; <span class="artist">Rich</span> also influenced <span class="artist">Paice</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="artistcredit">Cream</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Ginger Baker</span> cited <span class="artist">Roach</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Phil Seamen</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Baby Dodds</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Art Blakey</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Elvin Jones</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Philly Joe Jones</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Papa Jo Jones</span> as influences. <span id="ftnt_ref06" class="dotted" title="It doesn’t even stop with early hard rock, for that matter: the blast beat, a staple of modern death metal, black metal, and grindcore, originated in jazz, though the earliest examples were only commercially released much later. Sunny Murray performed one on a 1965 live recording of saxophonist Albert Ayler’s “Holy Ghost” that was first released on Ayler’s _Live in Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse Recordings_ (1998). Likewise, Tony Williams performed one on the Trio of Doom’s “Dark Prince”, recorded in 1979 but not released until 2007. Science may never be able to explain why this album languished in the vaults for 28 years, since the Trio of Doom consisted of Williams, John McLaughlin, and Jaco Pastorius – show me a jazz fan who doesn’t immediately want to hear them and I’ll show you a liar.">In short, every major early hard rock drummer took a huge amount of inspiration from jazz drumming.<a href="#ftnt06" class="normal">&#8317;⁶&#8318;</a></span></p>

						<p>I’m sure I don’t have to tell you this (the melody was already in your head the moment you read the translation), but this is loosely inspired by the most diabolically unsingable earworm since <span class="artistcredit">a-ha</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Take on Me</strong>”</span>, 40 years ago.

						<p>Although this song’s title comes from the last line of <span class="artistcredit">Genesis</span>’ <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Firth of Fifth</strong>”</span>, the song itself is actually more strongly inspired by <span class="artistcredit">Nick Drake</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>River Man</strong>”</span>. I’d been writing about the unity of opposites shortly before I began working on this song, and doing so made me fully aware that two separate but related concepts from the Greek philosopher <span class="artistcredit">Heraclitus</span> influenced the line in question, namely <span class="toc-counter">“You can’t step in the same river twice”</span> and the unity of opposites. <span class="artist">Heraclitus</span>, perhaps correctly, perceived change as the only constant in the universe. Translating the <span class="artist">Genesis</span> quote to Greek therefore felt like the thing to do.</p>

						<p><span class="songcredit">“<strong>River Man</strong>”</span> is actually based on a four-chord progression, but it’s one of the oddest four-chord progressions you’ll ever hear: C minor, E&#9837;, A&#9837;7, C major. There are a few variants once the strings come in, but those four chords underpin it for its entire running time. Like this song, it’s also in <span class="fraction">5/4</span>. Its use of the Lydian dominant mode inspired me to open with a C7(&#9839;11) chord, which adds both B&#9837; and F&#9839; to the usual C major chord, thus employing both of Lydian dominant’s accidentals. From there, we go to E&#9837;maj7, A&#9837;add9, B&#9837;aug7, and A&#9837;7sus4. These are all very odd chords that, in the wrong context, might sound horribly dissonant, but they all somehow work together. I use other chords later in the song, but the main progression is just those five.</p>

						<p>This track also isn’t finished yet, which is why it starts building up and then just kind of stops. I think it’s my favorite of these tracks so far, though.</p>

						<p>Strangely, this is one of the few songs I’ve written in harmonic minor in years. For some reason I’ve tended to prefer natural minor, or some of the less frequently used modes like Dorian, Phrygian, and even Locrian.</p>

						<p>Despite this track being longer than half of the tracks on this record at present, I think it’s probably got a lot more work to be done than a few of the shorter pieces. In particular, I intend to give it a more complex chord sequence – at present, it’s mostly i-iv-i-V-i-iv-V, and then whatever diminished 7th chord leads most appropriately to the next inversion of the i chord. At the start of the song, the chord sequences travel up; midway through, they start to travel down. There needs to be at least one other chord progression, probably two given the length of this song. I think the tension it’s building up is rather promising, though.</p>

						<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to determine why I might name a song written in 2025 after Edward Gibbon’s <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>. (<span class="dotted" id="ftnt_ref07" title="Roughly, “Furthermore, I propose that the Romans are to be sent home.” It is a very witty double reference to Cato the Elder’s “Ce&#772;terum censeo&#772; Cartha&#772;ginem de&#772;lendam esse” (“Furthermore, I propose that Carthage is to be destroyed”), you see. ¶ …Well, you might be laughing if you’d studied Roman history and Latin for several years. Though you’d still find the Monty Python scene way funnier. (In fact, you’d probably find it even funnier than you find it now.) ¶ For fans of brevity, the “Cartha&#772;go de&#772;lenda est” equivalent of the above is “Ro&#772;ma&#772;ni&#772; eundi&#772; domum sunt.” (In fact, since Latin is a zero-copula language, we can further shorten both statements at the expense of less explicitly conveying present exigencies: “Cartha&#772;go de&#772;lenda” and “Ro&#772;ma&#772;ni&#772; eundi&#772; domum,” respectively.)"><em>Ce&#772;terum censeo&#772; <a href="https://youtu.be/IIAdHEwiAy8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="noprintlink">ro&#772;ma&#772;no&#772;s eundo&#772;s domum esse</a>.</em><span class="linktext"> &#10216;youtu<wbr />.be<wbr />/IIAdHEwiAy8&#10217;</span><a href="#ftnt07" class="normal">&#8317;&#8311;&#8318;</a></span>)</p>

						<p>Another piece named after a classic of 18th-century political literature, this one by <span class="artistcredit">Edmund Burke</span>. The general academic consensus is that <span class="artist">Burke</span> meant it as satire of the deistic rationalist <span class="artistcredit">Lord Bolingbroke</span>, but his satire was so convincingly written that, much like much of <span class="artistcredit">Jonathan Swift</span>’s work (which was one of <span class="artist">Burke</span>’s primary influences), <em class="albumcredit">Vindication</em> has been read as sincere (e.g., by <span class="artistcredit">Murray Rothbard</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Joseph Sobran</span>). The philosophical anarchist <span class="artistcredit">William Godwin</span>, while recognizing <span class="artist">Burke</span>’s satire, nonetheless was willing to support for real the arguments he made satirically. In the 21st century, it’s easy to see why:</p>

						<blockquote class="toc-counter">The most obvious division of society is into rich and poor; and it is no less obvious, that the number of the former bear a great disproportion to those of the latter. The whole business of the poor is to administer to the idleness, folly, and luxury of the rich; and that of the rich, in return, is to find the best methods of confirming the slavery and increasing the burdens of the poor. In a state of nature, it is an invariable law, that a man’s acquisitions are in proportion to his labours. In a state of artificial society, it is a law as constant and as invariable, that those who labour most enjoy the fewest things; and that those who labour not at all have the greatest number of enjoyments. A constitution of things this, strange and ridiculous beyond expression! We scarce believe a thing when we are told it, which we actually see before our eyes every day without being in the least surprised.</blockquote>

						<p>And:</p>

						<blockquote class="toc-counter">The rich in all societies may be thrown into two classes. The first is of those who are powerful as well as rich, and conduct the operations of the vast political machine. The other is of those who employ their riches wholly in the acquisition of pleasure. As to the first sort, their continual care and anxiety, their toilsome days and sleepless nights, are next to proverbial. These circumstances are sufficient almost to level their condition to that of the unhappy majority; but there are other circumstances which place them in a far lower condition. Not only their understandings labour continually, which is the severest labour, but their hearts are torn by the worst, most troublesome, and insatiable of all passions, by avarice, by ambition, by fear and jealousy. No part of the mind has rest. Power gradually extirpates from the mind every humane and gentle virtue. Pity, benevolence, friendship, are things almost unknown in high stations.</blockquote>

						<p>Since <em class="albumcredit">Vindication</em> was first published anonymously, many readers took it to be <span class="artist">Bolingbroke</span>’s actual work and not a satire of his style, including <span class="artistcredit">Lord Chesterfield</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Bishop Warburton</span>. Although <em class="albumcredit">Vindication</em> received uniformly positive reviews, particularly for the quality of <span class="artist">Burke</span>’s writing, some reviewers missed the satire. <span class="artistcredit">Richard Hurd</span> argued that <span class="artist">Burke</span> had so effectively imitated <span class="artist">Bolingbroke</span>’s style that he had practically defeated his own purpose, saying he <span class="toc-counter">“should take care by a constant exaggeration to make the <em>ridicule</em> shine through the Imitation. Whereas this <em class="albumcredit">Vindication</em> is everywhere enforc’d, not only in the language, and on the principles of <span class="artist">L. Bol.</span>, but with so apparent, or rather so real an earnestness, that half his purpose is sacrificed to the other.”</span> In other words, <span class="artist">Hurd</span> was suggesting, <span class="artist">Burke</span> had mustered such effective arguments in service of his satire of <span class="artist">Bolingbroke</span> that, even though he hadn’t intended them sincerely, many readers nonetheless might well find them convincing.</p>

						<p>Nonetheless, I also often agree entirely with <span class="artist">Burke</span>’s non-satirical writing, e.g.:</p>

						<blockquote class="toc-counter">
							Whenever a separation is made between liberty and justice, neither, in my opinion, is safe.
							<blockquote class="speaker">–<strong class="petitecaps">Edmund Burke</strong>, letter to M. de Menonville, 1789-10</blockquote>
						</blockquote>

						<blockquote class="toc-counter">
							Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom.
							<blockquote class="speaker">–<strong class="petitecaps">Edmund Burke</strong>, <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> (1790)</blockquote>
						</blockquote>

						<p>He’s always thought-provoking even when I don’t agree with him.</p>

						<p>In any case, I doubt anyone else will hear this, but <span class="artistcredit">Ennio Morricone</span>’s <span class="songcredit">«<strong>L’estasi dell’oro</strong>»</span> (<span class="translation">“<strong>The Ecstasy of Gold</strong>”</span>), from 1966’s <em class="albumcredit">Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo</em> (<em class="translation">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</em>) was my vague inspiration to begin writing this. The reason I don’t think anyone else will hear it is that I very quickly went in an entirely different direction, for which I blame ADHD.</p>

(The only pop songs I’d definitively rank above it are <span class="artist">the Beach Boys</span>’ own <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Good Vibrations</strong>”</span> at #2 and <span class="artistcredit">ABBA</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Dancing Queen</strong>”</span> at #1, though a few others undoubtedly tie it.)</p>
						
						<p>Since <span class="artistcredit">Brian Wilson</span>’s death earlier this year, I’d been wanting to compose a tribute. I can decide neither what the best <span class="artist">Beach Boys</span> track is nor which is my favorite, so I consulted the opinions of <span class="artist">Wilson</span>’s peers. What <span class="artistcredit">Paul McCartney</span> calls “the greatest song ever written” and <span class="artistcredit">Hans Zimmer</span> calls “a perfect song” felt like the ideal song to write a tribute to; in fact, I never really considered any other track in their discography.</p>

						<p>(To clarify: I consider <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Good Vibrations</strong>”</span> <span class="artist">the Beach Boys</span>’ best <em>pop song</em>, specifically: it’s perfectly written, arranged, performed, and produced; as catchy as anything else they ever made; <em>and</em> one of the most complex songs in their discography. This doesn’t mean I consider it their best song overall, nor does it mean I <em>don’t</em> consider it their best song. They just have so many masterpieces that I can’t pick: <span class="songcredit">“<strong>In My Room</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Don’t Worry Baby</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Help Me, Rhonda</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>California Girls</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Wouldn’t It Be Nice</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Let’s Go Away for Awhile</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Here Today</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Caroline, No</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Heroes and Villains</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Cabin Essence</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Child Is Father of the Man</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Surf’s Up</strong>”</span>, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Sail On, Sailor</strong>”</span>, and I could easily double this list with little effort.)</p>

						<p>I’d actually been trying for a few days to write something that seemed <em>inspired</em> by <span class="songcredit">“<strong>God Only Knows</strong>”</span> without borrowing its chords outright. Nothing I tried really felt close enough until this track. The first eight measures’ progression is similar, but not identical, to the original track’s chords. After that, just to drive the point home, I outright borrowed some chords from the verses, chorus, and bridge, though often in modified form.</p>

						<p>This is still in its early stages, but I feel it contains the seeds of something powerful. I hope to expand it as a tribute to <em class="albumcredit">Smile</em> and make it a ten-minute epic (or even longer, if I can sustain the quality). If so, I’ll rename it <span class="songcredit" lang="grc">«<strong>Ε&#787;φηβι&#774;κη&#769; συ&#774;μφωνι&#774;&#769;α&#772; προ&#769;ς Θεω&#834;&#837;</strong>»</span> (<em class="toc-counter" lang="grc">«<span class="romanization">Ephe&#772;bi&#774;ke&#772;&#769; su&#774;mpho&#772;ni&#774;&#769;a&#772; pro&#769;s Theo&#772;i&#770;</span>»</em>, <span class="translation">“<strong>Adolescent Symphony to God</strong>”</span>, paraphrasing <span class="toc-counter">“teenage symphony to God”</span>, <span class="artist">Wilson</span>’s concept for <em class="albumcredit">Smile</em>), use <span class="songcredit" lang="grc">«<strong>Θεο&#769;ς μο&#769;νον γιγνω&#769;σκει</strong>»</span> as this movement’s title, and title other movements after the songs they most resemble.

							<p>I’ve seen electric guitarists match or exceed them in up to two of those categories: e.g., <span class="artistcredit">Eddie Van Halen</span> had their technicality and showmanship, but not their emotional intensity, while <span class="artistcredit">Gary Moore</span> exceeded their technicality and possibly even their emotional intensity, but wasn’t as much of a showman.

							<p>Acoustic and electric guitar are basically completely different instruments, but a few acoustic players I’ve heard might match them on all three counts: definitely <span class="artistcredit">Marcin Patrzalek</span>, perhaps also <span class="artistcredit">Tommy Emmanuel</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Lucas Imbiriba</span>.

							<p>(Addendum, a month later: <span class="artistcredit">Anthony Vincent</span> also does a good job sounding like <span class="artist">Cornell</span>. The fact that I can count his credible imitators on one hand speaks volumes about how difficult he is to mimic, though.)</p>
