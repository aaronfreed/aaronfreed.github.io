			The album title is my Attic Greek translation of part of a famous quote by – who else? – <span id="ftnt_ref01" class="dotted" title="“If, with the literate, I am / Impelled to try an epigram, / I never seek to take the credit: / We all assume that Oscar said it.” —Dorothy Parker ¶ Of course, Miss Parker herself has probably become one of the figures to whom quotes are most commonly misattributed, along with Wilde, Mark Twain, Shakespeare, Yogi Berra (who, in response to this, remarked, “I really didn’t say everything I said”), and George Carlin."><span class="artistcredit">Oscar Wilde</span>.<a href="#ftnt01" class="normal">&#8317;¹&#8318;</a></span>

			<p>The historical irony is that the Ancient Greek Cynics were, despite the term’s modern usage, actually some of the most idealistic people in history – indeed, many gave away all their possessions, placing them about as far from Wilde’s quote as humanly possible. Translating it into Attic Greek therefore amused me.</p>

						<p>A very early work in progress that’s meant to be a loose style pastiche of the <span class="artistcredit">Nightwish</span> track it’s named after. It doesn’t actually feel very close yet, which isn’t all that surprising, since <span class="artistcredit">Tuomas Holopainen</span>’s composition style is deceptively complex. I’m not entirely certain where this one is going yet, or if I’m even going to attempt to finish it in this style – I may end up going in a completely different direction with it.</p>
						
						<p>Even if I don’t, it already sounds like it belongs in a ’90s JRPG, so I’ll probably lean into the <span class="artistcredit">Nobuo Uematsu</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Yasunori Mitsuda</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Hiroki Kikuta</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Yoko Shimomura</span><wbr />/<wbr /><span class="artistcredit">Motoi Sakuraba</span> style as much as I can. I’ve been listening to all five for over two decades, and the first three in particular are such fundamental influences on my style that I’m not sure I could write something without their influence on it if I tried. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urBpdyFCZmo" target="_blank">As a great Canadian philosopher once wrote</a>: <span class="toc-counter">If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.</span> A corollary of this principle is that if you try <em>not</em> to sound like an act, they have still influenced you.</p>

						<p>There’s probably also some conspicuous <span class="artistcredit">Genesis</span> influence on this – another fundamental influence on my songwriting that I don’t think I could dispel if I tried (I’ve been listening to them even longer, since my very early childhood). I can’t think of a popular music composer with more skill at key changes than <span class="artistcredit">Tony Banks</span>.</p>
						
						<p>I avoided key changes in the music I was writing for <em class="albumcredit">Tempus Irae Redux</em>, where the music would sometimes mix with a chant drone on C; thus, key changes could introduce unintended dissonance. I also haven’t used them in my <em class="albumcredit">Endless Sky</em> tracks: they’re meant to be built on-the-fly based on game conditions, which requires everything to be in the same key for optimal results (I’ve settled on G minor). As a result, actually being able to use key changes in a new composition for once has felt oddly liberating.</p>
						
						<p>Naturally, this modulates keys a few times, using some variant of <span class="artistcredit">John Coltrane</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Giant Steps</strong>”</span> progression, if memory serves. Just don’t ask me to improvise over it.</p>

						<p>This song uses some deliberately eerie and even dissonant chord progressions, and I pretty quickly settled on effectively making the evil twin of <span class="artistcredit">Genesis</span>’ <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Watcher of the Skies</strong>”</span>, just with added disco influence (despite the song also being in <span class="fraction">7/4</span>). The idea is to make it both as evil-sounding and as funky as possible.</p>

						The title is a segment of an apocryphal Chinese curse translated into Traditional Chinese. This track will have three movements, all titled after apocryphal Chinese curses that I’ve translated to Traditional Chinese:

						<p>The late, dearly lamented <span class="artistcredit">Sir Terry Pratchett</span> had this to say:</p>

							<blockquote class="toc-counter">“The phrase ‘may you live in interesting times’ is the lowest in a trilogy of Chinese curses that continue ‘may you come to the attention of those in authority’ and finish with ‘may the gods give you everything you ask for.’ I have no idea about its authenticity.”</blockquote>

						<p>They are, to repeat myself, apocryphal. I can’t really claim to read either Traditional or Simplified Chinese, nor to speak any of the Chinese languages, but I find it rather fitting for a Westerner’s translations of apocryphal Chinese curses to possess what I’m sure is the awkward syntax I’ve imbued them with, so I don’t think that’s actually a problem. If my versions sound like a case of <span class="toc-counter">“<span id="ftnt_ref02" class="dotted" title="“Foreigner”, “outsider”, “stranger”, or “non-family member”. More importantly, it uses the same characters (「外人」) and is descended from the same Middle Chinese word as the Japanese word ｢gaijin｣, though it seems to lack the latter’s derogatory connotations."><em>wa&#768;ire&#769;n</em><a href="#ftnt02" class="normal">&#8317;²&#8318;</a></span> trying (unsuccessfully) to make a Western fabrication sound authentically Chinese,”</span> that seems genuinely apropos.</p>

						<p>In any case, an identical translation of <span class="toc-counter">“May you live in interesting times”</span> to mine appears on dozens of Chinese-language websites, so I’m sure that’s correct, but I can’t find the other two, so it’s possible that no one took the liberty of translating <span class="artist">Pratchett</span>’s curses to Chinese before I did, which strikes me as a shame.</p>
						
						<p>(I originally simplified the second curse to <span class="toc-counter" lang="zh">「願當局注意你」</span> [<em class="toc-counter">｢Yua&#768;n da&#772;ngju&#769; zhu&#768;yi&#768; ni&#780;｣</em>, <span class="toc-counter">“May the authorities take notice of you”</span>] because I very definitely didn’t feel I understood Chinese grammar well enough to do his full version justice, but I’ve come around to thinking that an awkward translation would fit better, and I like the idea of all three movement titles being equally long.)</p>

						<p>To clarify some why I referred to “Chinese <em>languages</em>” in the plural: Written Chinese is one language, or at most two languages (Traditional and Simplified); it essentially represents Classical Chinese, which is no more spoken today than Latin (<span id="ftnt_ref03" class="dotted" title="“even though I myself speak Latin… somewhat.”"><em>tamenetsi&#772; egomet lati&#772;ne&#772; loquor… aliquantum</em><a href="#ftnt03" class="normal">&#8317;³&#8318;</a></span>). <em>Spoken</em> Chinese, by contrast, <em>isn’t</em> a single language; it’s a language <em>family</em>. By far the majority of Chinese speakers (a cool 800 million) speak Standard Mandarin. Runners-up Southern Min, Shanghainese, and Cantonese have an order of magnitude fewer speakers than Standard Mandarin – which still means more speakers than all but about two dozen other languages, and more <em>native</em> speakers than all but about a dozen others.</p>

						<p>(Southern Min and Shanghainese are each estimated to have slightly more speakers than Cantonese, but good luck finding any classes in anything other than Standard Mandarin or Cantonese outside China. Also, Standard Mandarin has more than twice as many native speakers [990 million] than the runner-up, Spanish [484 million], but when we count non-native speakers, English actually emerges as the world’s most widely spoken language, with over 1.5 billion total speakers; Mandarin has slightly under 1.2 billion.)</p>

						<p>My hot take is that spoken Chinese is only considered a single language for political reasons: namely, that China’s government insists on it. (It doesn’t help that <span class="toc-counter">「方言」</span>、 <em class="toc-counter">｢fa&#772;ngya&#769;n｣</em>, the Chinese word most often translated <span class="toc-counter">“dialect”</span>, isn’t actually a precise match for that word, so this may be a case of an imprecise translation directly causing a semantic argument.) Standard Mandarin and Cantonese are no more the same language than Italian and Spanish – maybe even less so, as Italian and Spanish are somewhat mutually intelligible. Chinese is sometimes called a macrolanguage, but that seems wrong to me, since many spoken Chinese <em>fa&#772;ngya&#769;n</em> are mutually unintelligible. Chinese linguists themselves often classify Chinese as a language family, following <span class="artistcredit">Fu Maoji</span>’s formulation in the <em class="albumcredit">Encyclopedia of China</em>, and that seems as accurate a classification as one could ask for.</p>

						<p>One interesting fact I learned researching the above: Modern Standard Arabic has no native speakers. All Arabic speakers learn their local dialects at home and Modern Standard Arabic in school. (Imagine speakers of Romance languages learning their native languages at home and New Latin in school and you’ll be in the same ballpark.) Egyptian Arabic is the Arabic dialect with the most native speakers.</p>

						<p>Dedicated, of course, to <span class="artistcredit">Ozzy Osbourne</span> (1948-2025). Loosely inspired by <span class="artistcredit">Black Sabbath</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>War Pigs</strong>”</span> (composed by <span class="artistcredit">Geezer Butler</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Tony Iommi</span>, <span class="artist">Osbourne</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Bill Ward</span>) and <span class="artistcredit">T-Pain</span>’s live cover thereof (performed by <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Curt Chambers</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Rodney Jones Jr.</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Clemons Poindexter</span>, & <span class="artistcredit">Joe Flip Wilson</span>).</p>

						<p>I need to stress that I’m not being facetious here: no less a source than <span class="artist">Osbourne</span> himself declared <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s version <span class="toc-counter">“the greatest <span class="songcredit">‘<strong>War Pigs</strong>’</span> cover ever”</span>. (<span class="artist">Butler</span> likewise called it <span class="toc-counter">“excellent”</span>.) <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s vocals are absolutely killer, and he and his band clearly <em>get</em> not just <span class="artist">Black Sabbath</span> but hard rock and heavy metal as a whole on a fundamental level, throwing in a guitar lick from <span class="artistcredit">Jeff Beck</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Beck’s Bolero</strong>”</span> here, a vocal tic from <span class="artistcredit">Disturbed</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Down with the Sickness</strong>”</span> there. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone do a better job covering <span class="artist">Geezer Butler</span> and <span class="artist">Bill Ward</span> than <span class="artist">Jones</span> and <span class="artist">Poindexter</span> do on the live recording, and <span class="artist">Chambers</span> demonstrates combined degrees of technicality, showmanship, and emotional intensity I’d only previously seen <span id="ftnt_ref04" class="dotted" title="I’ve seen electric guitarists match or exceed them in up to two of those categories: e.g., Eddie Van Halen had the technicality and showmanship, but not the emotional intensity; Gary Moore exceeded them in technicality and perhaps even emotional intensity, but not showmanship. (Moore’s technicality and emotional intensity may be the best I’ve ever heard: imagine Carlos Santana with Van Halen’s ability to shred and you won’t be far off.) ¶ Acoustic guitar is basically a completely different instrument, but a few acoustic players I’ve heard may match them for all three: definitely Marcin Patrzalek, perhaps also Tommy Emmanuel and Lucas Imbiriba. (Imbiriba deserves further props for another seemingly impossible feat: pulling off a faithful vocal cover of Chris Cornell without face-planting. I’ve only heard other people pull off Cornell covers in completely different styles – e.g., Haley Reinhart & Postmodern Jukebox’s “Black Hole Sun”. And Imbiriba does it while playing insanely complex parts.)">from <span class="artistcredit">Jimi Hendrix</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Prince</span>, and had grown afraid no electric guitarist would ever show again.<a href="#ftnt04" class="normal">&#8317;⁴&#8318;</a></span></p>

						<p>But my favorite part is the arrangement: in particular, the reharmonization of the song’s final verse may well be my favorite moment of any cover ever. That’s partly because it’s a <em>beautiful</em> chord progression; it also just <em>fits</em> so well that I almost wish the song had been written like that in the first place. Lyrically, <span class="songcredit">“<strong>War Pigs</strong>”</span> is an explicitly religious sermon against war that ends with warmongers being condemned to hell at Judgement Day, so bumping the gospel music influence up to eleven for that stanza was truly inspired.</p>

						<p>This track uses a chord progression similar, but not quite identical, to their reharmonization. Of course, I rarely write songs with only one set of chord changes, so inevitably, I wander out into left field from there.</p>

						<p>This track’s shuffle rhythm is also no accident. It’s partly inspired by <span class="artist">T-Pain</span>’s cover, but just as heavily inspired by <span class="artist">Sabbath</span> themselves. All the major early hard rock and metal drummers were heavily inspired by jazz; <span class="artist">Bill Ward</span> grew up listening to big band music and cited <span class="artistcredit">Gene Krupa</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Buddy Rich</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Louie Bellson</span> as his earliest influences. The swing in <span class="artist">Sabbath</span>’s playing is hard to overstate and often overlooked.</p>

						<p>This isn’t just true of <span class="artist">Ward</span>; for instance, <span class="artistcredit">Led Zeppelin</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">John Bonham</span> cited <span class="artist">Krupa</span>, <span class="artist">Rich</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Max Roach</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Joe Morello</span> as influences. This is obvious in his playing; the isolated drums of <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Stairway to Heaven</strong>”</span> are so heavily syncopated that, in another context, they could be the foundation of a club banger. <span class="artist">Krupa</span>’s influence extends beyond <span class="artist">Ward</span> and <span class="artist">Bonham</span> to <span class="artistcredit">Deep Purple</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Ian Paice</span> and <span class="artistcredit">the Who</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Keith Moon</span>; <span class="artist">Rich</span> also influenced <span class="artist">Paice</span>. Meanwhile, <span class="artistcredit">Cream</span>’s <span class="artistcredit">Ginger Baker</span> cited <span class="artist">Roach</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Phil Seamen</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Baby Dodds</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Art Blakey</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Elvin Jones</span>, <span class="artistcredit">Philly Joe Jones</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Papa Jo Jones</span> as influences. <span id="ftnt_ref05" class="dotted" title="It doesn’t even stop with early hard rock, for that matter: the blast beat, a staple of modern death metal, black metal, and grindcore, originated in jazz, though the earliest examples were only commercially released much later. Sunny Murray performed one on a 1965 live recording of saxophonist Albert Ayler’s “Holy Ghost” that was first released on Ayler’s _Live in Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse Recordings_ (1998). Likewise, Tony Williams performed one on the Trio of Doom’s “Dark Prince”, recorded in 1979 but not released until 2007. Science may never be able to explain why this album languished in the vaults for 28 years, since the Trio of Doom consisted of Williams, John McLaughlin, and Jaco Pastorius – show me a jazz fan who doesn’t immediately want to hear them and I’ll show you a liar.">In short, every major early hard rock drummer took a huge amount of inspiration from jazz drumming.<a href="#ftnt05" class="normal">&#8317;⁵&#8318;</a></span></p>

							<p class="upperpara">I’ve seen electric guitarists match or exceed them in up to two of those categories: e.g., <span class="artistcredit">Eddie Van Halen</span> had their technicality and showmanship, but not their emotional intensity, while <span class="artistcredit">Gary Moore</span> exceeded their technicality and possibly even their emotional intensity, but wasn’t as much of a showman. (<span class="artist">Moore</span>’s technicality and emotional intensity may be the best I’ve ever heard: imagine <span class="artistcredit">Carlos Santana</span> with <span class="artist">Van Halen</span>’s ability to shred and you won’t be too far off.)</p>
							<p class="lowerpara">Acoustic and electric guitar are basically completely different instruments, but a few acoustic players I’ve heard might match them on all three counts: definitely <span class="artistcredit">Marcin Patrzalek</span>, perhaps also <span class="artistcredit">Tommy Emmanuel</span> and <span class="artistcredit">Lucas Imbiriba</span>. (Whether he matches the showmanship, <span class="artist">Imbiriba</span> deserves further props for another seemingly impossible feat: doing a relatively faithful vocal cover of <span class="artistcredit">Chris Cornell</span> while playing insanely complex guitar parts. I’ve heard other people pull off <span class="artist">Cornell</span> covers, but only by completely changing the vocal style – <span class="artistcredit">Haley Reinhart & Postmodern Jukebox</span>’s cover of <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Black Hole Sun</strong>”</span> comes to mind. <span class="artist">Imbiriba</span> is the only vocalist I’ve ever heard come even close to sounding like <span class="artist">Cornell</span> without face-planting.)</p>

						<td>It doesn’t even stop with early hard rock, for that matter: the blast beat, a staple of modern death metal, black metal, and grindcore, originated in jazz, though the earliest examples were only commercially released much later. <span class="artistcredit">Sunny Murray</span> performed one on a 1965 live recording of saxophonist <span class="artistcredit">Albert Ayler</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Holy Ghost</strong>”</span> that was first released on <span class="artist">Ayler</span>’s <em class="albumcredit">Live in Greenwich Village: The Complete Impulse Recordings</em> (1998). Likewise, <span class="artistcredit">Tony Williams</span> performed one on the <span class="artistcredit">Trio of Doom</span>’s <span class="songcredit">“<strong>Dark Prince</strong>”</span>, recorded in 1979 but not released until 2007. Science may never be able to explain why this album languished in the vaults for 28 years, since the <span class="artist">Trio of Doom</span> consisted of <span class="artist">Williams</span>, <span class="artistcredit">John McLaughlin</span>, and <span class="artistcredit">Jaco Pastorius</span> – show me a jazz fan who doesn’t immediately want to hear them and I’ll show you a liar.</td>
