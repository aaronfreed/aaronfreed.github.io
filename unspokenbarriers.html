			<h1 class="centred" id="opening">Opening statement</h1>

			<ul>
				<li>Neurodivergent people have trouble communicating and empathizing with neurotypicals, and vice versa, because of the double empathy problem.</li>
				<li>I’d like to explain why this happens, how it wreaks havoc, and how we can fix it.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="personalbackground">Personal background</h1>

			But first, some personal background:

			<h1 class="centred" id="rethinkingignorance">Rethinking “ignorance”</h1>

			<h2 class="centred" id="socrates">Socrates</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>I’d like to open by quoting Socrates, and I apologize to any Greeks in the audience for my pronunciation.
					<ul>
						<li>Greek: «Ἕν μόνον ᾰ̓γᾰθόν εἶναι, τὴν ἐπιστήμην, καὶ ἓν μόνον κακόν, τὴν ᾰ̓μᾰθῐ́ᾱν.»</li>
						<li>Romanized: «Hén mónon ăgăthón eînai, tḕn epistḗmēn, kaí hén mónon kakón, tḕn ămăthĭ́ān.»</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>I have a <a href="amathiakaiagnoia.html" target="_blank">longer explanation</a> on my website, but I’d translate this as:
					<ul>
						<li>Literal: &ldquo;There is only one good, learning, and there is only one evil, willful ignorance.&ldquo;</li>
						<li>Figurative: “Learning is the only good, refusal to learn the only evil.”</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>That may come across as a slight exaggeration, but <em>amathia</em>, or refusal to learn, causes numerous problems.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a></p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="amathiakaiagnoia">Two forms of ignorance: <em>amathia</em> and <em>agnoia</em></h2>
	
			<ul>
				<li>What we call <em>ignorance</em>, the Ancient Greeks divided into two words with separate etymologies and meanings:
					<ul>
						<li><strong><em>Agnoia</em></strong>, <em>not knowing</em>, is curable and our natural state.
							<ul>
								<li>We’re not born with knowledge; we have to learn.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong><em>Amathia</em></strong>, <em>not learning</em>, is intentional and incurable – which is why Socrates calls it evil.
							<ul>
								<li>To twist a familiar proverb: “You can lead a horse to knowledge, but you can’t make it think.”</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The word <em>ignorance</em> carries an implicit moral judgement that <em>agnoia</em> doesn’t deserve.
					<ul>
						<li>It also doesn’t diagnose the source of the problem.</li>
						<li>Therefore, I’ll use <em>amathia</em> and <em>agnoia</em> throughout this talk. The distinction matters.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="doubleempathy">The double empathy problem</h1>

			<ul>
				<li>The autism researcher Damian Milton coined the term <strong><em>double empathy problem</em></strong> to explain neurotypicals’ and neurodivergents’ trouble communicating and empathizing with each other.</li>
				<li>Contrary to common belief, autistic people usually find it easy to communicate and empathize <em>with each other</em>.
					<ul>
						<li>But we can have more trouble communicating and empathizing with neurotypicals.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The reverse is also true: neurotypicals also have trouble communicating and empathizing <em>with us</em>.</li>
				<li>But there’s a catch:
					<ul>
						<li>Many of us <em>know</em> we have trouble communicating and empathizing with neurotypicals and take steps to alleviate it.</li>
						<li>However, neurotypicals rarely realize they have trouble communicating and empathizing <em>with us</em>, and thus <em>don’t</em> try.
							<ul>
								<li>Thus, neurodivergent people may actually practice empathy more often than neurotypicals.</li>
								<li>I said <em>practice empathy</em> deliberately: I consider empathy an <em>action</em>, not a character trait.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="neurodivergentcommunication">Neurodivergent communication</h1>

			<p>I’ll quickly explain neurodivergent people’s natural communication – which is, by necessity, a generalization; probably everything I’m about to say will have some exceptions.</p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="innatetraits">Innate traits</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>We tend to be much more direct, without engaging in much small talk.
					<ul>
						<li>We can learn to do small talk, but we rarely find it easy.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Neurotypicals can perceive our voices as monotone even when we’re actually feeling strong emotion.</li>
				<li>Our body language differs from neurotypicals’ body language, and even from each other’s.</li>
				<li>Neurodivergence is diagnosed less often in women.
					<ul>
						<li>This may be because their symptoms present differently and are less popularly understood.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a></p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="mirroringandmasking">Mirroring and masking</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Neurotypicals misreading our natural body language causes us such trouble we learn to <strong>mirror</strong> – to mimic the nonverbal communication they expect.</li>
				<li>Mirroring is in turn a form of <strong>masking</strong> – concealing our true selves from others.</li>
				<li>This is draining, and we can’t always do it, especially when stressed.
					<ul>
						<li>This can be misread as anger towards specific people, which causes further stress and turns into a self-reinforcing <strong>feedback loop</strong>: stress causes more stress causes more stress, <em>ad nauseam</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="impacts">Impacts of communication barriers</h1>

			<p>Communication barriers cause us problems in several areas of life.</p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="workimpact">Work</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Hiring is overwhelmingly tailored to neurotypical skills and preferences, even in disciplines like STEM where they’re less important.</li>
				<li>Miscommunications can also cause problems - again, stress being misread as anger.</li>
				<li>Many public-facing positions expect soft social skills that many of us never learned and that can create additional stress for those of us that did.</li>
				<li>Overall, we’re tremendously underemployed. Estimates of our unemployment rates range from 38.58% to 85% – vastly higher numbers than the neurotypical rate.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a></p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="socialimpact">Social lives</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Our social lives can also suffer from our different communication styles.
					<ul>
						<li>Many of my dates probably thought I was less interested in them than I was – eye contact causes me trouble at the best of times, and dates make me especially nervous.</li>
						<li>I think it’s sensible for neurodivergent people to have relationships with each other.
							<ul>
								<li>We wouldn’t expect the kinds of nonverbal communication that we find stressful and that neurotypicals find effortless.</li>
								<li>We also probably wouldn&rsquo;t need to mirror or mask with each other.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We also have high comorbidities with several mood-related disorders.
					<ul>
						<li>Our suicide rate is nine times the median.</li>
						<li>Neurotypicals’ life expectancy is twice ours. Childhood deaths are one major cause of this; suicide is another.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="twowaystreet">How to improve communication: a two-way street</h1>

			<ul>
				<li>There are several ways we could improve neurodivergent-neurotypical communication.</li>
				<li>Most importantly: communication is a two-way street.
					<ul>
						<li>Many neurotypicals blame communication trouble solely on us.</li>
						<li>But, as the double empathy problem suggests, the problem is reciprocal.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a></p>

			<h2 class="centred" id="activelistening">Active listening</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Active listening</strong> is an important skill everyone can practice.
					<ul>
						<li>Rephrase the other person’s statements in your own words.</li>
						<li>Ask substantive <strong>clarifying questions</strong> about what they just said.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>This is an important, effective way to ensure you’ve understood each other.
					<ul>
						<li>It also helps us practice empathy.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="centred" id="goldenrule">Rethinking the Golden Rule</h2>

			<h3 class="centred" id="selfcentered">The Golden Rule is self-centered</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>The Golden Rule is a fundamentally self-centered conception of ethics.</li>
				<li>Rephrased, it says: “Treat others how <em><strong>you</strong></em> want to be treated.”
					<ul>
						<li>This centers your entire ethical system around <em>your</em> preferences.</li>
						<li>This has a fundamental flaw: your preferences aren’t universal.</li>
						<li>This might be appropriate to teach kindergarteners who haven’t moved beyond <strong>solipism</strong> (the inability to perceive that others are people). But adults should do better.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="sectionbreak"><a href="#top">Table of contents</a> &middot; <a href="index.html">Website index</a> &middot; <a href="aboutme.html">Contact me</a></p>

			<h3 class="centred" id="platinumrule">The Platinum Rule: a simple one-word fix</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Platinum Rule</strong> fixes this by changing one word:
					<ul>
						<li>“Treat others how <em><strong>they</strong></em> want to be treated.”</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>This is a vastly superior principle that centers ethics around understanding and respecting others’ varied preferences.
					<ul>
						<li>This alone could vastly improve neurotypical-neurodivergent communication.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We begin with <em>agnoia</em> of others’ preferences.
					<ul>
						<li>But assuming we know them turns this into <em>amathia</em>.</li>
						<li>Don’t assume you know what others want. <em>Ask</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="centred" id="howtohelp">How specific groups can help</h1>

			<ul>
				<li>I have more recommendations for several groups.</li>
				<li>I’m not judging you if you haven’t addressed these <em>yet</em>: again, <em>agnoia</em> is our default state.</li>
				<li>But please think about these questions going forward.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="centred" id="employerquestions">Questions for employers</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Does your current hiring process advantage extroverts or neurotypicals?
					<ul>
						<li>If so, how can you reform it to avoid rejecting qualified neurodivergent applicants?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How well do you try to understand employees’ needs?</li>
				<li>Do you make assumptions about nonverbal communication that might stress neurodivergent employees?</li>
				<li>Do neurodivergent employees feel safe <strong>disclosing</strong> their neurodivergence in your work culture?
					<ul>
						<li>Some employees will have had prior bad experiences that would make them reluctant to disclose even in the best of environments.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Without knowing, do you assume employees are neurodivergent?
					<ul>
						<li>Assuming this might not be bad <em>if</em> you work to accommodate their needs and preferences.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do you pay people a living wage at 40 hours a week?
					<ul>
						<li>Outside of brief sprints, humans’ productivity tops out at a median 40 hours a week.</li>
						<li>Thus, having to work 60 hours a week to make ends meet results in 20 unproductive hours at work &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t even save employers money.
							<ul>
								<li>If 60 hours a week at $20 an hour only nets 40 hours of productivity, 40 hours a week at $30 an hour would cost the same amount of money and result in the same productivity – if not more.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>In fact, low wages arguably cost many employers money.
							<ul>
								<li>Not pushing employees past their capacity will reduce burnout, increase employee retention, improve institutional memory, and save on training costs.</li>
								<li>Living wages will also attract more qualified applicants.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Giving people noise-free, interruption-free environments helps immensely. Larger rooms can help too.
					<ul>
						<li>Computers can multitask. Humans can’t, much as we might delude ourselves into thinking otherwise.</li>
						<li>Interruptions break our trains of thought, after which we have to spend time getting ourselves back up to speed.</li>
						<li>Focusing on one task at a time gives us objectively better results faster.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h2 class="centred" id="educatorquestions">Questions for educators</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Do you make assumptions about your students’ nonverbal communications?</li>
				<li>How well do you accommodate neurodivergent students?
					<ul>
						<li>For instance, ADHD students can be entitled to more test time or lecture notes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do you attempt to incorporate different learning styles?
					<ul>
						<li>For instance, visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic.</li>
						<li>Other learning models exist as well; Wikipedia has a good overview.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How approachable are you?
				<li>Do you help students deal with trauma and stress?
					<ul>
						<li>If you’re unable to do so, can you direct them to people that can help?</li>
					</ul>

			</ul>

			<h2 class="centred" id="neurodivergentquestions">Questions for neurodivergent students and employees</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Are we disclosing our neurodivergence?
					<ul>
						<li>Is that a good idea?
							<ul>
								<li>If so, <em>when</em> is it a good idea?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>These questions can even apply to friendship and dating.</li>
						<li>I have no definite answers and doubt one-size-fits-all answers exist, but they’re worth considering.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Are we <strong>self-advocating</strong> when we’re the best equipped people in the room to do so?
					<ul>
						<li>If we aren’t, are we trying to learn how to become self-advocates?</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Are we attempting to be aware of and to respect unspoken and unwritten rules?
					<ul>
						<li>Not all rules should be respected, but we should at least be aware of them, so that if we’re breaking them, we’re doing so intentionally.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How much do we <strong>network</strong>?
					<ul>
						<li>Often, getting a job is a matter of <em>who</em> you know, not <em>what</em> you know.</li>
						<li>I don’t feel good about that, either, but I’m also a pragmatist.
							<ul>
								<li>Deal with existing systems: not the systems we’d <em>like</em>, but the systems we actually have.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

			<h2 class="centred" id="thingseveryonecando">Things everyone can do</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Practice active listening. Rephrase others in your own words. Ask clarifying questions.</li>
				<li>Don’t assume what others’ preferences are. <em>Ask.</em></li>
				<li>Seek to fix <em>agnoia</em>. Respect good-faith engagement; state unspoken or unwritten rules that people find unclear or confusing.
					<ul>
						<li>But don’t tolerate <em>amathia</em>.
							<ul>
								<li>If people continually engage in bad faith and refuse to learn lessons they’re continually presented with, they’re just taking advantage, which isn’t respectable at all.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When you ask someone to do something, explain <em>why</em>.
					<ul>
						<li>“Don’t interrupt” is far less memorable than “Interruptions make others lose their train of thought and make the discussion harder for other participants to follow”.</li>
						<li>The latter explains <em>why</em> you shouldn’t interrupt, making it far more memorable.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Be willing to learn and try new things.
					<ul>
						<li>Don’t be afraid of failure. It’s a harsh teacher, but it’s often the best and most memorable.</li>
						<li>Trying the same thing over and expecting different results is <em>not</em> insanity. It’s <em>practice</em>. We improve at tasks through repetition.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Also, stop trying to see yourself as the hero of your own story.
					<ul>
						<li>To fix flaws, we must acknowledge them. Trying to see ourselves as heroes makes that harder.</li>
						<li><em>Actions</em> and <em>beliefs</em> can be good or bad, but unless we’re talking monsters like Hitler or Stalin, <em>people</em> are too complicated to sum up in such black-and-white terms.</li>

			<h2 class="centred" id="quotes">Quotes</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>“The brighter the light, the darker the shadow it casts.” –Ren, “Hi Ren” (paraphrasing Carl Jung)
					<ul>
						<li>This describes <strong>enantodromia</strong>: without balance, many things become their opposites. Seek balance.</li>
						<li>“Hi Ren”, the source of this quote, is one of this century’s profoundest statements on mental health.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>“The best is the mortal enemy of the good.” –Montesqieu
					<ul>
						<li>Don’t seek perfection; just seek to improve. We’re all works in progress. Freaking out too much over mistakes, imperfections, or flaws makes them harder to fix.</li>
						<li>Flaws can make art more powerful. Kurt Cobain’s voice crack at the end of Nirvana’s “Where Did You Sleep Last Night” <em>makes the song</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>“Be the change you want to see.” –Arleen Lorrance (paraphrasing Mohandas K. Gandhi)
					<ul>
						<li>Change starts within. Lead by example.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>And since I opened by quoting Socrates, I’ll close with wisdom from famed philosopher Bill S. Preston, Esq.:
					<ul>
						<li>“Be excellent to each other.”</li>
					</ul>
